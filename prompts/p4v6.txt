Now identify the source population. The correct source population is based on the study participantsâ€™ racial/ethnic background, regardless of geographic location, and refers to humans specifically. Exclude plants and therapeutics that may originate in the region and non-human animal models. The options are humans descending from Central Asia (CA), Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), East Asia (EA), Latin America & Caribbean (LAC), Middle East & North Africa (MENA), South East Asia & Pacific Islands (SEAP), South Asia (SA), Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), the United States of America and Canada (NA), or Western Europe (WE). 

Add the classification of the source population to the table in a separate column. You may only use the abbreviation of the source populations provided.
