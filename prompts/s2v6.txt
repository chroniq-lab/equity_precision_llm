Here are the inclusion criteria:  

PRECISION MEDICINE: Precision medicine is an assessment of genetic or metabolic state to guide preventive and therapeutic decisions in humans – including gaining more understanding. Exclude epidemiological studies using traditional biomarkers only, focusing on omics (genomics, metabolomics, proteomics, lipidomics etc.) or multi-omics studies.  Include genome-wide linkage analysis and genetic analyses—including phylogenetic analysis and genotype-phenotype association. Including alleles, human genome, and genes.

DIABETES: Do not exclude any type of diabetes or prediabetes. The presence of certain conditions or risk factors may not definitively confirm that the study is related to diabetes or prediabetes, unless there is a clear link to diabetes pathophysiology, diagnosis, or management. If the paper doesn’t state diabetes directly, classify it as "no"

PRIMARY STUDY: All types of studies, other than meta-analysis and systematic reviews, were evaluated as primary studies. Although it may bias the studies towards counting contributions of large biorepositories, secondary analysis of previously collected datasets was also included since these generate novel insights into the pathophysiology of diabetes for source populations that these biorepositories sample from.
