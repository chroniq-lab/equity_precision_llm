Title: Candidate genes involved in cardiovascular risk factors by a family-based association study on the island of Kosrae, Federated States of Micronesia  

Abstract: Altered plasma levels of lipids and lipoproteins, obesity, hypertension, and diabetes are major risk factors for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. To identify genes that affect these traits and disorders, we looked for association between markers in candidate genes (apolipoprotein AII (apo AII), apolipoprotein AI-CIII-AIV gene cluster (apo AI-CIII-AIV), apolipoprotein E (apo E), cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7a), hepatic lipase (HL), and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP)) and known risk factors (triglycerides (Tg), total cholesterol (TC), apolipoprotein AI (apo AI), apolipoprotein AII (apo AII), apolipoprotein B (apo B), body mass index (BMI), blood pressure (BP), leptin, and fasting blood sugar (FBS) levels.) A total of 1,102 individuals from the Pacific island of Kosrae were genotyped for the following markers: Apo AII/MspI, Apo CIII/SstI, Apo AI/XmnI, Apo E/HhaI, CETP/TaqIB, CYP7a/BsaI, HL/DraI, and MTP/HhpI. After testing for population stratification, family-based association analysis was carried out. Novel associations found were: 1) the apo AII/MspI with apo AI and BP levels, 2) the CYP7a/BsaI with apo AI and BMI levels. We also confirmed the following associations: 1) the apo AII/MspI with Tg level; 2) the apo CIII/SstI with Tg, TC, and apo B levels; 3) the Apo E/HhaI E2, E3, and E4 alleles with TC, apo AI, and apo B levels; and 4) the CETP/TaqIB with apo AI level. We further confirmed the connection between the apo AII gene and Tg level by a nonparametric linkage analysis. We therefore conclude that many of these candidate genes may play a significant role in susceptibility to heart disease.
