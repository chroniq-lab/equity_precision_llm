Title: [Gd- allele distribution patterns in Azerbaijan. III. The identification of mutant forms of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase] 

Abstract: In 28 families with G6PD deficiency living in 3 settlements of Shekii district of Azerbaijan 11 G6PD variants of II and III classes differing by kinetic properties were identified according WHO program. 9 of them are characterized with the same electrophoretic mobility. Comparison of G6PD spectra in two subpopulations and in a mixed group permits to make a conclusion about existence of common and rare G6PD alleles in examined population. They distribute by gene drift supported by natural selection. Among 7 samples of G6PD with normal and increased activity two new variants of IV class -- Nukha and Bash-Kungut -- were found.
