Results: A total of 30, 42, and 28% of participants were in CKD stage 3a, 3b and 4, respectively. The proportions of participants based on ethnicity were 51% Malay, 24% Chinese and 25% Indian. The mean (Â±SD) age and body mass index were 60.5 Â± 9.0 years and 28.3 Â± 5.9 kg/m2 , whereas mean HbA1c and serum 25(OH)D were 7.9 Â± 1.6% and 37.1 Â± 22.2 nmol/L. HbA1c was negatively correlated with serum 25(OH)D (rs = -0.314, P = 0.002), but positively correlated with body mass index (rs = 0.272, P = 0.006) and serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P = 0.006). There was a significant negative correlation between serum 25(OH)D and total daily dose of insulin prescribed (rs = -0.257, P = 0.042). Regression analyses showed that every 10-nmol/L decline in serum 25(OH)D was associated with a 0.2% increase in HbA1c ._x000D_

14729856,Differential effects of the C1431T and Pro12Ala PPARgamma gene variants on plasma lipids and diabetes risk in an Asian population,"We investigated the association of C1431T and Pro12Ala polymorphisms at the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) locus with plasma lipids and insulin resistance-related variables, according to diabetes status, in a large and representative Asian population from Singapore consisting of 2,730 Chinese, 740 Malays, and 568 Indians. Moreover, we estimated the diabetes risk and examined gene-nutrient interactions between these variants and the ratio of polyunsaturated fatty acid to saturated fat (SFA) in determining body mass index (BMI) and fasting insulin. We found differential effects of these gene variants. The Pro12Ala polymorphism was more associated with plasma lipids and fasting glucose concentrations, whereas the C1431T polymorphism was related to the risk of diabetes. Carriers of the 12Ala allele had higher HDL-cholesterol than did Pro12Pro homozygotes (P < 0.05), and the effect of the 12Ala allele on fasting glucose was modified by diabetes status (P < 0.001). After controlling for confounders, carriers of the T allele had decreased risk of diabetes compared with CC homozygotes [odds ratio (OR) 0.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.58-0.93; P = 0.011]; this effect was stronger in Indians (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.15-0.92; P = 0.032). For both polymorphisms, normal subjects carrying the less prevalent allele had higher BMI (P < 0.05). The PUFA/SFA did not modify the effect of these polymorphisms on BMI or insulin.","Adult, Asia, Blood Glucose, Body Mass Index, Diabetes Mellitus, Fatty Acids, Fatty Acids, Unsaturated, Female, Humans, Insulin, Insulin Resistance, Lipids, Male, Middle Aged, Mutation, Missense, PPAR gamma, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide, Risk Factors",yes,yes,sa,yes,SA,14729856.0, Differential effects of the C1431T and Pro12Ala PPARgamma gene variants on plasma lipids and diabetes risk in an Asian population ,yes,yes,yes,seap,,False
34605849,Association of Statin Therapy Initiation With Diabetes Progression: A Retrospective Matched-Cohort Study,"Statin therapy has been associated with increased insulin resistance; however, its clinical implications for diabetes control among patients with diabetes is unknown.To assess diabetes progression after initiation of statin use in patients with diabetes.This was a retrospective matched-cohort study using new-user and active-comparator designs to assess associations between statin initiation and diabetes progression in a national cohort of patients covered by the US Department of Veterans Affairs from fiscal years 2003-2015. Patients included were 30 years or older; had been diagnosed with diabetes during the study period; and were regular users of the Veterans Affairs health system, with records of demographic information, clinical encounters, vital signs, laboratory data, and medication usage.Treatment initiation with statins (statin users) or with H2-blockers or proton pump inhibitors (active comparators).Diabetes progression composite outcome comprised the following: new insulin initiation, increase in the number of glucose-lowering medication classes, incidence of 5 or more measurements of blood glucose of 200 mg/dL or greater, or a new diagnosis of ketoacidosis or uncontrolled diabetes.From the 705â€¯774 eligible patients, we matched 83â€¯022 pairs of statin users and active comparators; the matched cohort had a mean (SD) age of 60.1 (11.6) years; 78 712 (94.9%) were men; 1715 (2.1%) were American Indian/Pacific Islander/Alaska Native, 570 (0.8%) were Asian, 17 890 (21.5%) were Black, and 56 633 (68.2 %) were White individuals. Diabetes progression outcome occurred in 55.9% of statin users vs 48.0% of active comparators (odds ratio, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.35-1.40; Pâ€‰<â€‰.001). Each individual component of the composite outcome was significantly higher among statin users. Secondary analysis demonstrated a dose-response relationship with a higher intensity of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol lowering associated with greater diabetes progression.This retrospective matched-cohort study found that statin use was associated with diabetes progression, including greater likelihood of insulin treatment initiation, significant hyperglycemia, acute glycemic complications, and an increased number of prescriptions for glucose-lowering medication classes. The risk-benefit ratio of statin use in patients with diabetes should take into consideration its metabolic effects.","Blood Glucose, Cardiovascular Diseases, Diabetes Mellitus, Disease Progression, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors, Male, Middle Aged, Retrospective Studies, United States, Veterans",no,yes,sa,yes,SA,34605849.0, Association of Statin Therapy Initiation With Diabetes Progression: A Retrospective Matched-Cohort Study ,no,yes,yes,Unknown,,False

18299980,Early anti-oxidative and anti-proliferative curcumin effects on neuroglioma cells suggest therapeutic targets,"Curcumin (diferuloyl), from the Indian spice turmeric, reduces oxidative damage and induces apoptosis. Utilizing DNA microarrays, we have demonstrated that a low (5 microM) dose of curcumin added to a mixture of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes (C6 rat glioma cells) in culture for 24 and 48 h significantly modulates gene expression in four primary pathways: oxidative stress, cell cycle control, and DNA transcription and metabolism. Contribution of the pentose phosphate pathway to the pool of NADH upregulates glutathione and activates aldehyde oxidase. We have identified also several new genes, up- or downregulated by curcumin, namely, aldo-keto reductase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and aldehyde oxidase that protect against oxidative stress. The identification of several new cell cycle control genes, including the apoptosis-related protein (pirin) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF), and of the neurofilament M protein involved in neurogenesis suggests that curcumin may have applicability in the treatment of a spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases.","Animals, Antioxidants, Cell Line, Tumor, Cell Proliferation, Cluster Analysis, Curcumin, Gene Expression Profiling, Gene Expression Regulation, Glioma, Oligodendroglia, Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis, Rats",no,no,Unknown,yes,SA,18299980.0, Early anti-oxidative and anti-proliferative curcumin effects on neuroglioma cells suggest therapeutic targets ,no,no,yes,none,,False

This paper examines the association between ED, testosterone deficiency syndrome (TDS) and metabolic syndrome (MS) in Malaysian men in an urban setting. One thousand and forty-six men aged â‰¥ 40 years from Subang Jaya, Malaysia were randomly selected from an electoral-roll list. The men completed questionnaires that included: socio-demographic data, self-reported medical problems and the International Index of erectile function (IIEF-5). Physical examination and the following biochemical tests were performed: lipid profile, fasting blood glucose (FBG) and total testosterone. The response rate was 62.8% and the mean age of men was 55.8 Â± 8.4 (41-93) years. Ethnic distribution was Chinese, 48.9%; Malay, 34.5%; Indian, 14.8%. The prevalence of moderate-severe ED was 20.0%, while 16.1% of men had TDS (< 10.4 nmol/L) and 31.3% of men had MS. Indian and Malay men were significantly more likely to have ED (p â€‰= 0.001), TDS (p â€‰< 0.001) and MS (p < 0.001) than the Chinese. Multivariate regression analysis showed that elevated blood pressure, elevated FBG, low high-density lipoprotein and heart disease were predictors of ED while all MS components were independently associated with TDS. Malay and Indian men have a higher disease burden compared to Chinese men and were more likely to suffer with ED, TDS and MS. MS components were closely related to TDS and ED.","Adult, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Asian People, Blood Glucose, Erectile Dysfunction, Heart Diseases, Humans, Hypertension, Lipids, Lipoproteins, HDL, Malaysia, Male, Men's Health, Metabolic Syndrome, Middle Aged, Prevalence, Severity of Illness Index, Surveys and Questionnaires, Testosterone",no,no,sa,yes,SA,22115177.0," The triad of erectile dysfunction, testosterone deficiency syndrome and metabolic syndrome: findings from a multi-ethnic Asian men study (The Subang Men's Health Study) ",no,no,yes,seap,,False

35169870,Epigenome-wide association study of incident type 2 diabetes: a meta-analysis of five prospective European cohorts,"Type 2 diabetes is a complex metabolic disease with increasing prevalence worldwide. Improving the prediction of incident type 2 diabetes using epigenetic markers could help tailor prevention efforts to those at the highest risk. The aim of this study was to identify predictive methylation markers for incident type 2 diabetes by combining epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) results from five prospective European cohorts.We conducted a meta-analysis of EWASs in blood collected 7-10Â years prior to type 2 diabetes diagnosis. DNA methylation was measured with Illumina Infinium Methylation arrays. A total of 1250 cases and 1950 controls from five longitudinal cohorts were included: Doetinchem, ESTHER, KORA1, KORA2 and EPIC-Norfolk. Associations between DNA methylation and incident type 2 diabetes were examined using robust linear regression with adjustment for potential confounders. Inverse-variance fixed-effects meta-analysis of cohort-level individual CpG EWAS estimates was performed using METAL. The methylGSA R package was used for gene set enrichment analysis. Confirmation of genome-wide significant CpG sites was performed in a cohort of Indian Asians (LOLIPOP, UK).The meta-analysis identified 76 CpG sites that were differentially methylated in individuals with incident type 2 diabetes compared with control individuals (p values <1.1â€‰Ã—â€‰10-7). Sixty-four out of 76 (84.2%) CpG sites were confirmed by directionally consistent effects and p values <0.05 in an independent cohort of Indian Asians. However, on adjustment for baseline BMI only four CpG sites remained genome-wide significant, and addition of the 76 CpG methylation risk score to a prediction model including established predictors of type 2 diabetes (age, sex, BMI and HbA1c) showed no improvement (AUC 0.757 vs 0.753). Gene set enrichment analysis of the full epigenome-wide results clearly showed enrichment of processes linked to insulin signalling, lipid homeostasis and inflammation.By combining results from five European cohorts, and thus significantly increasing study sample size, we identified 76 CpG sites associated with incident type 2 diabetes. Replication of 64 CpGs in an independent cohort of Indian Asians suggests that the association between DNA methylation levels and incident type 2 diabetes is robust and independent of ethnicity. Our data also indicate that BMI partly explains the association between DNA methylation and incident type 2 diabetes. Further studies are required to elucidate the underlying biological mechanisms and to determine potential causal roles of the differentially methylated CpG sites in type 2 diabetes development.Â© 2022.

30830355,Urine metabolites are associated with glomerular lesions in type 2 diabetes,"Little is known about the association of urine metabolites with structural lesions in persons with diabetes.We examined the relationship between 12 urine metabolites and kidney structure in American Indians with type 2 diabetes.Data were from a 6-year clinical trial that assessed renoprotective efficacy of losartan, and included a kidney biopsy at the end of the treatment period. Metabolites were measured in urine samples collected within a median of 6.5Â months before the research biopsy. Associations of the creatinine-adjusted urine metabolites with kidney structural variables were examined by Pearson's correlations and multivariable linear regression after adjustment for age, sex, diabetes duration, hemoglobin A1c, mean arterial pressure, glomerular filtration rate (iothalamate), and losartan treatment.Participants (nâ€‰=â€‰62, mean age 45â€‰Â±â€‰10Â years) had meanâ€‰Â±â€‰standard deviation glomerular filtration rate of 137â€‰Â±â€‰50Â ml/min and median (interquartile range) urineÂ albumin:creatinine ratio of 34 (14-85) mg/g near the time of the biopsy.

In contrast, few studies have been conducted within minority groups, which carry the highest burden of impaired glucose homeostasis and type 2 diabetes in the U.S.As part of the 'Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) Consortium, we investigated the association of up to 10 GWAS-identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 8 genetic regions with glucose or insulin concentrations in up to 36,579 non-diabetic subjects including 23,323 European Americans (EA) and 7,526 African Americans (AA), 3,140 Hispanics, 1,779 American Indians (AI), and 811 Asians. We estimated the association between each SNP and fasting glucose or log-transformed fasting insulin, followed by meta-analysis to combine results across PAGE sites.Overall, our results show that 9/9 GWAS SNPs are associated with glucose in EA (p = 0.04 to 9 × 10-15), versus 3/9 in AA (p= 0.03 to 6 × 10-5), 3/4 SNPs in Hispanics, 2/4 SNPs in AI, and 1/2 SNPs in Asians. For insulin we observed a significant association with rs780094/GCKR in EA, Hispanics and AI only.Generalization of results across multiple racial/ethnic groups helps confirm the relevance of some of these loci for glucose and insulin metabolism.

23029454,A single nucleotide polymorphism within DUSP9 is associated with susceptibility to type 2 diabetes in a Japanese population,"The DUSP9 locus on chromosome X was identified as a susceptibility locus for type 2 diabetes in a meta-analysis of European genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and GWAS in South Asian populations identified 6 additional single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci for type 2 diabetes. However, the association of these loci with type 2 diabetes have not been examined in the Japanese. We performed a replication study to investigate the association of these 7 susceptibility loci with type 2 diabetes in the Japanese population.We genotyped 11,319 Japanese participants (8,318 with type 2 diabetes and 3,001 controls) for each of the 7 SNPs-rs5945326 near DUSP9, rs3923113 near GRB14, rs16861329 in ST6GAL1, rs1802295 in VPS26A, rs7178572 in HMG20A, rs2028299 near AP3S2, and rs4812829 in HNF4A-and examined the association of each of these 7 SNPs with type 2 diabetes by using logistic regression analysis.All SNPs had the same direction of effect (odds ratio [OR]>1.0) as in the original reports. One SNP, rs5945326 near DUSP9, was significantly associated with type 2 diabetes at a genome-wide significance level (pâ€Š=â€Š2.21Ã—10(-8); OR 1.39, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.24-1.56). The 6 SNPs derived from South Asian GWAS were not significantly associated with type 2 diabetes in the Japanese population by themselves (pâ‰¥0.007).

30369944,"Genetic Variants Related to Cardiometabolic Traits Are Associated to B Cell Function, Insulin Resistance, and Diabetes Among AmeriCan Indians: The Strong Heart Family Study","Background: Genetic research may inform underlying mechanisms for disparities in the burden of type 2 diabetes mellitus among American Indians. Our objective was to assess the association of genetic variants in cardiometabolic candidate genes with B cell dysfunction via HOMA-B, insulin resistance via HOMA-IR, and type 2 diabetes mellitus in the Strong Heart Family Study (SHFS). Methods and Results: We examined the association of variants, previously associated with cardiometabolic traits (∼200,000 from Illumina Cardio MetaboChip), using mixed models of HOMA-B residuals corrected for HOMA-IR (cHOMA-B), log transformed HOMA-IR, and incident diabetes, adjusted for age, sex, population stratification, and familial relatedness. Center-specific estimates were combined using fixed effect meta-analyses. We used Bonferroni correction to account for multiple testing (P < 4.13 × 10-7). We also assessed the association between variants in candidate diabetes genes with these metabolic traits. We explored the top SNPs in an independent, replication sample from Southwestern Arizona. We identified significant associations with cHOMA-B for common variants at 26 loci of which 8 were novel (PRSS7, FCRL5, PEL1, LRP12, IGLL1, ARHGEF10, PARVA, FLJ16686). The most significant variant association with cHOMA-B was observed on chromosome 5 for an intergenic variant near PARP8 (rs2961831, P = 6.39 × 10-9). In the replication study, we found a signal at rs4607517 near GCK/YKT6 (P = 0.01). Variants near candidate diabetes genes (especially GCK and KCNQ1) were also nominally associated with HOMA-IR and cHOMA-B. Conclusion: We identified variants at novel loci and confirmed those at known candidate diabetes loci associations for cHOMA-B.

24051404,Analysis of Gln223Agr polymorphism of Leptin Receptor Gene in type II diabetic mellitus subjects among Malaysians,"Leptin is known as the adipose peptide hormone. It plays an important role in the regulation of body fat and inhibits food intake by its action. Moreover, it is believed that leptin level deductions might be the cause of obesity and may play an important role in the development of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), as well as in cardiovascular diseases (CVD). The Leptin Receptor (LEPR) gene and its polymorphisms have not been extensively studied in relation to the T2DM and its complications in various populations. In this study, we have determined the association of Gln223Agr loci of LEPR gene in three ethnic groups of Malaysia, namely: Malays, Chinese and Indians. A total of 284 T2DM subjects and 281 healthy individuals were recruited based on International Diabetes Federation (IDF) criteria. Genomic DNA was extracted from the buccal specimens of the subjects. The commercial polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method was carried out by proper restriction enzyme MSP I to both amplify and digest the Gln223Agr polymorphism. The p-value among the three studied races was 0.057, 0.011 and 0.095, respectively. The values such as age, WHR, FPG, HbA1C, LDL, HDL, Chol and Family History were significantly different among the subjects with Gln223Agr polymorphism of LEPR (p < 0.05).","Adult, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Alleles, Asian People, Case-Control Studies, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2, Female, Gene Frequency, Genetic Loci, Genotype, Humans, Malaysia, Male, Middle Aged, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide, Receptors, Leptin",yes,yes,sa,yes,SA,24051404.0, Analysis of Gln223Agr polymorphism of Leptin Receptor Gene in type II diabetic mellitus subjects among Malaysians ,yes,yes,yes,seap,,False
29470850,Identification and functional analysis of a novel G310D variant in the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) gene associated with type 2 diabetes in American Indians,"Insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) is involved in cell growth and glucose homeostasis. In the current study, the IGF1R locus was analysed as a candidate gene for type 2 diabetes (T2D) in American Indians.Whole genome sequence data from 335 American Indians identified 3 novel missense variants in IGF1R. The associations of IGF1R variants with T2D, age of T2D onset and birth weight were analysed in a population-based sample of 7701 American Indians.A novel glycine-to-aspartic acid substitution (G310D) in IGF1R was identified, which associated with T2D in a sex-specific manner (Psex interactionÂ =Â 0.02). In women, the aspartic acid (D) allele (frequencyÂ =Â 0.034) was associated with increased risk for T2D (nÂ =Â 4292, PÂ =Â 2.0Â Ã—Â 10-5 adjusted for age, birth year, and the first 5 genetic principal components; odds ratio [OR]Â =Â 2.23 [1.54-3.23] per risk allele) and an earlier age of T2D onset (nÂ =Â 4292, PÂ =Â 2Â Ã—Â 10-4 , hazard rate ratioÂ =Â 1.45 [1.20-1.75], Psex interactionÂ =Â 0.05).

Among 85 siblings discordant for G310D, carriers of the D-allele had shorter stature as compared with carriers of the G-allele (Î²Â =Â -1.6Â cm, PÂ =Â .001, within family model). The G310D variant was functionally studied in vitro, where the D-allele had a 22% increase (PÂ =Â .0005) in FOXO1-induced transcriptional activity, due to decreased activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway mediated through reduced IGF1R activity.A unique G310D variant in IGF1R, which occurs in 6% American Indians, may impair IGF1R signalling pathways, thereby increasing the risk of T2D.Published 2018.

20857895,Prevalence of CYP450 gene variations in patients with type 2 diabetes,"Drug degradation in the human organism is driven by detoxification mechanisms that can be affected in their efficiency by genetic mutations. The purpose of this pilot investigation was to investigate whether Type 2 diabetes is associated with mutations in prominent members of the CYP 450 isoenzyme family.Genomic DNA was isolated from EDTA blood samples of 203 Caucasian subjects (101 patients with Type 2 diabetes and 102 non-diabetic subjects, age (mean +/- STD): 49 +/- 16 years) was analyzed. Genomic DNA was isolated from EDTA blood. Mutation analysis for CYP2C8 (*2/*3/*4), CYP2C9 (*2/*3), CYP2C19 (*2/*3), CYP2D6 (*3/*4/*5/*6) and PPARgamma (P12A) was performed by means of real-time PCR methods (Light-Cycler, Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA).The genotyping revealed the following allele frequency distributions for the two investigated groups: CYP2C8: *2 (type 2 diabetes 3% vs. 1%, n.s.), *3 (16% vs. 3%, n.s.), *4 (15% vs. 2%, p < 0.05), CYP2C9: *2 (20% vs. 24%, n.s.), *3 (22% vs. 21%, n.s.), CYP2C19: *2 (23% s. 33%, n.s.), *3 (0% vs. 0%, n.s.), CYP2D6: *3 (3% vs. 4%, n.s.), *4 (40% vs. 37%, n.s.), *5 (3% vs. 2%, n.s.), *6 (0% vs. 0%, n.s.), PPARgamma P12A (15% vs. 21%, n.s.), i.e. all but one mutation (CYP2C8*4) were found with equal prevalence in the two cohorts.In this pilot investigation, we found an increased prevalence of the CYP2C8*4 mutation in the Type 2 diabetic patient group. This may result in a modification of drug degradation and drug efficacy in these patients and may have an influence, e.g. on the choice of anti-diabetic drugs. However, further trials are necessary in order to confirm our findings.","Cross-Sectional Studies, Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System, DNA Mutational Analysis, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2, Female, Gene Frequency, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, Genotype, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, PPAR gamma, Pilot Projects, Polymorphism, Genetic",yes,yes,we,yes,SA,20857895.0, Prevalence of CYP450 gene variations in patients with type 2 diabetes ,yes,yes,yes,cee,,False
24101674,A genome-wide association study in American Indians implicates DNER as a susceptibility locus for type 2 diabetes,"Most genetic variants associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have been identified through genome-wide association studies (GWASs) in Europeans. The current study reports a GWAS for young-onset T2DM in American Indians. Participants were selected from a longitudinal study conducted in Pima Indians and included 278 cases with diabetes with onset before 25 years of age, 295 nondiabetic controls ≥45 years of age, and 267 siblings of cases or controls. Individuals were genotyped on a ∼1M single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array, resulting in 453,654 SNPs with minor allele frequency >0.05. SNPs were analyzed for association in cases and controls, and a family-based association test was conducted. Tag SNPs (n = 311) were selected for 499 SNPs associated with diabetes (P < 0.0005 in case-control analyses or P < 0.0003 in family-based analyses), and these SNPs were genotyped in up to 6,834 additional Pima Indians to assess replication. Rs1861612 in DNER was associated with T2DM (odds ratio = 1.29 per copy of the T allele; P = 6.6 × 10(-8), which represents genome-wide significance accounting for the number of effectively independent SNPs analyzed). Transfection studies in murine pancreatic β-cells suggested that DNER regulates expression of notch signaling pathway genes.

22434276,A combination of metabolomics and metallomics studies of urine and serum from hypercholesterolaemic rats after berberine injection,"Berberine, long used as a remedy in China and India for intestinal infections, has been discovered in recent years in western countries and is now being used to treat ailments ranging from urinary tract infections to diabetes and obesity. In order to study the effect of berberine more deeply, a combined metabolomic and metallomic approach was developed in this study using the hypercholesterolaemic rat model, which involved the use of proton nuclear magnetic resonance for the analysis of rat urine to achieve metabolic fingerprinting and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry for the analysis of rat blood serum to achieve metallomic fingerprinting. The results obtained indicated that major metabolic processes like Krebs cycle, cholesterol metabolism and osmoregulation in hypercholesterolaemic rats are perturbed upon berberine injection. In addition, the changes of some elements, such as V, Mn, Na and K, revealed in the metallomic study may contribute to the search of new biomarkers for hypercholesterolaemic disease. We concluded that both the metabolomic and metallomic profiles of berberine-treated hypercholesterolaemic rats were different from those of the control group and that the selected metabolites and elements could probably be applied as potential biomarkers for the understanding of the effect of berberine on biochemical process in the animal model. Such a multi-analytical approach will potentially provide an information-rich platform for the elucidation of effects of xenobiotics and drug efficacy studies.","Animals, Berberine, Coptis, Hypercholesterolemia, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, Mass Spectrometry, Metabolome, Metabolomics, Metals, Rats, Rats, Sprague-Dawley",no,no,sa,yes,SA,22434276.0, A combination of metabolomics and metallomics studies of urine and serum from hypercholesterolaemic rats after berberine injection ,yes,no,no,Unknown,,False
35796441,Antiapoptotic and antioxidative efficacy of rhizomes of Curcuma amada on the management of diabetes-induced male infertility in albino rat: An effective fraction selection study,"Men with diabetes have negative effects on reproduction that causes sexual dysfunction. Medicinal plants are non-toxic and much safer than synthetic drugs because regular use of synthetic drugs shows long-term side effects. Curcuma amada (Roxb) is a medicinal plant used in Ayurveda and Unani medicinal systems in India. The goal of this study is to rummage the potential efficiency of the most potent solvent fraction of effective extract of hydro-methanol 60:40 of C. amada rhizome on male gonadal hypofunction in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rat. Diabetes-induced testicular hypofunction was evaluated by glycemic, spermiological, biochemical, genomic, flow cytometric, and histology of testicular tissue. The n-hexane, chloroform, ethyl-acetate, and n-butanol solvent fractions of the said extract were administrated for 4â€‰weeks at 10Â mg dose/100â€‰g body weight/day. Among all the used fractions, the ethyl-acetate solvent fraction-treated group showed maximum recovery in serum insulin (177.42%), sperm count (92.84%), sperm motility (97.15%), and serum testosterone (164.33%). The diabetic rats treated with ethyl-acetate solvent fraction also exhibited the maximum resettlement in flow cytometric analysis of sperm viability (55.84%) and sperm mitochondrial integrity (149.79%), gene expression patterns of key markers for androgenesis (Î”5, 3Î²-HSD 87.50%, and 17Î²-HSD 74.66%) and apoptosis (Bax 44.63%, Bcl-2 54.03%, and Caspase-3 35.77%) along with testicular histology. The ethyl-acetate fraction contains alkaloids, flavonoids, and polyphenols where all of these components are not present in other fractions, may be the most effective cause for the recovery of diabetes-linked oxidative stress-mediated testicular hypofunctions. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Nowadays worldwide, the use of synthetic drugs are reduced due to their toxic effect. At present, synthetic drugs are replaced by several herbal drugs, the natural source of medicine which has many therapeutic values. C. amada has strong antioxidant activity due to the presence of bio-active compound(s) that can able to manage streptozotocin-induced diabetes linked to oxidative damage of male gonadal organs. Therefore, these bio-active compound(s)-containing said medicinal plant may use as a good source of antioxidative food in the food industry as nutraceuticals and in pharmaceutical industries for the development of the herbal drug to manage diabetes-linked male gonadal hypofunctions. At present, WHO also gives emphasis for developing one drug-multi-disease therapy. From such a viewpoint, this active fraction-containing phytomolecules may have corrective efficacy against diabetes as well as oxidative stress-linked testicular complications.Â© 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","1-Butanol, Acetates, Animals, Antioxidants, Apoptosis, Caspase 3, Chloroform, Curcuma, Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental, Flavonoids, Humans, Infertility, Male, Insulins, Male, Methanol, Plant Extracts, Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2, Rats, Rhizome, Solvents, Sperm Motility, Streptozocin, Synthetic Drugs, Testosterone, bcl-2-Associated X Protein",no,yes,sa,yes,SA,35796441.0, Antiapoptotic and antioxidative efficacy of rhizomes of Curcuma amada on the management of diabetes-induced male infertility in albino rat: An effective fraction selection study ,no,yes,yes,Unknown,,False
25662186,"A cis-eQTL in PFKFB2 is associated with diabetic nephropathy, adiposity and insulin secretion in American Indians","A prior genome-wide association study (GWAS) in Pima Indians identified a variant within PFKFB2 (rs17258746) associated with body mass index (BMI). PFKFB2 encodes 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase isoform 2, which plays a role in glucose metabolism. To follow-up on the GWAS, tag SNPs across PFKFB2 were genotyped in American Indians (AI) who had longitudinal data on BMI (n = 6839), type 2 diabetes (T2D; n = 7710), diabetic nephropathy (DN; n = 2452), % body fat (n = 555) and insulin secretion (n = 298). Two SNPs were further genotyped in urban AI to assess replication for DN (n = 864). PFKFB2 expression was measured in 201 adipose biopsies using real-time RT-PCR and 61 kidney biopsies using the Affymetrix U133 array. Two SNPs (rs17258746 and rs11120137), which capture the same signal, were associated with maximum BMI in adulthood (β = 1.02 per risk allele, P = 7.3 × 10(-4)), maximum BMI z-score in childhood (β = 0.079, P = 0.03) and % body fat in adulthood (β = 3.4%, P = 3 × 10(-7)). The adiposity-increasing allele correlated with lower PFKFB2 adipose expression (β = 0.81, P = 9.4 × 10(-4)). Lower expression of PFKFB2 further correlated with higher % body fat (r = -0.16, P = 0.02) and BMI (r = -0.17, P = 0.02). This allele was also associated with increased risk for DN in both cohorts of AI [odds ratio = 1.64 (1.32-2.02), P = 5.8 × 10(-6)], and similarly correlated with lower PFKFB2 expression in kidney glomeruli (β = 0.87, P = 0.03). The same allele was also associated with lower insulin secretion assessed by acute insulin response (β = 0.78, P = 0.03) and 30-min plasma insulin concentrations (β = 0.78, P = 1.1 × 10(-4)). Variation in PFKFB2 appears to reduce PFKFB2 expression in adipose and kidney tissues, and thereby increase risk for adiposity and DN.Published by Oxford University Press 2015.

Aim: To replicate the relationships between HKDC1 rs4746822, BACE2 rs6517656, SLC16A11 rs13342232 and TMEM163 rs998451 with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in a Han Chinese population. Methods: This was a case-control study which enrolled 334 pregnant women with GDM and 367 pregnant women with normal glucose tolerance. The linear regression and logistic regression were used to estimate the association between SNPs with the risk of GDM, HOMA-IR and fasting insulin levels.

33524844,ITS 2 and RNA secondary structure-based analysis reveals a clear picture on phylogeny of South Indian Salacia spp,"The genus Salacia (Celastraceae) consists of many important medicinal plants used mainly against type II diabetes. Segregation and delimitation of species is difficult based on morphological features alone. DNA barcoding is the most effective and emerging method of molecular identification. It was reported that ITS2 has better discriminating power in the genus Salacia in comparison to other barcode loci. This paper describe the analysis of sequence and structural information of ITS2 to discriminate the species of Salacia. A total of 8 species of Salacia in South India and the available sequences in NCBI database were taken for the present study. NJ method based phylogenetic trees were constructed using MEGAX with primary sequence as well as using sequence and secondary structural information. Primary structure based phylogeny did not give much information whereas the dendrogram based on sequence and structural information was more informative to decipher the phylogeny of South Asian species of Salacia. The present study revealed some interesting facts regarding the genus. Secondary structure of the ITS2 sequence of S. chinensis reported from Kerala differs consistently from that of S. chinensis reported from other parts of India and of South Asia. Probably the S. chinensis in Kerala, India has diverged a lot from the original S. chinensis. ITS2 sequence of S. reticulata reported from Sri Lanka was identical to S. chinensis reported by other groups from Thailand and Udupi, India. The molecular level identity of ITS2 sequence of S. chinensis with S. reticulata suggest merger of the two species. ITS2 sequence of S. beddomei is only reported from Kerala, India showed it to be identical to S. macrosperma. This observation points to a mistaken identity of S. beddomei which could be elusive from Kerala. Phylogenetic trees constructed based on sequence and structural features of ITS2 suggest that the ancestor species of S.chinensis diversified in two evolutionary lines. One line leads to the present day S. chinensis and the other line further diversified and lead to the rest of the present day Salacia species.Copyright © 2021.

33577915,Ameliorative effect of white tea from 50-year-old tree of Camellia sinensis L. (Theaceae) on kidney damage in diabetic mice via SIRT1/AMPK pathway,"Diabetic kidney damage (DKD) is one of the most common complications of diabetes, which is known as a chronic inflammatory kidney disease caused by persistent hyperglycemia. White tea was originally used as a folk medicine to treat measles in ancient China. What arouses our interest is that there is a traditional method to treat diabetes with white tea taken from over 30-year-old tree of Camellia sinensis L. However, there are few reports on the renal protection of white tea.This present study was designed to study the potential protective effects of white tea (WT) and old tree white tea (OTWT) on high-fat-diet (HFD) combined with streptozotocin (STZ)-induced type 2 diabetic mice to explore the possible mechanism of WT/OTWT against DKD.C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into four groups: NC, T2D, WT (400Â mg/kgÂ·b.w, p.o.), OTWT (400Â mg/kgÂ·b.w, p.o.). Diabetes was established in all groups except NC group, by six weeks of HFD feeding combined with STZ (50Â mg/kg, i.p.) for 3 times, treatments were administered for six weeks and then all the animals were decapitated; kidney tissues and blood samples were collected for the further analysis, including: levels of insulin, lipid metabolism (TG, TC, HDL, LDL, FFA), antioxidative enzymes (catalase (CAT), super oxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx)), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatine, inflammatory cytokines (TNF-Î±, IL-1Î², COX-2, iNOS, MCP-1), advanced glycation end products (AGE), receptor of AGE (RAGE), Nrf2, AMPK, SIRT1, and PGC-1Î±. H&E, PAS and Masson staining were performed to examine the histopathological alterations of the kidneys.Our data showed that WT and OTWT reversed the abnormal serum lipids (TG, TC, HDL, LDL, FFA) in T2D mice, upregulated antioxidative enzymes levels (CAT, SOD, GPx) and inhibit the excessive production of proinflammatory mediators (including MCP-1, TNF-Î±, IL1Î², COX-2 and iNOS) by varying degrees, and OTWT was more effective. In histopathology, OTWT could significantly alleviate the accumulation of renal AGE in T2D mice, thereby improving the structural changes of the kidneys, such as glomerular hypertrophy, glomerular basement membrane thickening and kidney FIbrosis.Both WT and OTWT could alleviate the diabetic changes in T2D mice via hypoglycemic, hypolipidemic, anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects, while OTWT was more evident. OTWT could prominently alleviate the accumulation of AGE in the kidneys of T2D mice, thereby ameliorating the renal oxidative stress and inflammatory damage, which was associated with the activation of SIRT1/AMPK pathway.Copyright Â© 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Moreover, anticancer activity and novel mechanisms have been explored, the chance of regulating glucose and lipid metabolism in cancer cells showing more potential than ever. Therefore, it is expected that appropriate pharmaceutical procedures could be applied to the enormous potential for anticancer efficacy, to give some new insights into anticancer drug preparation in Chinese medicine.We accessed conventional databases, such as PubMed, Scope, and Web of Science, using ""berberine hydrochloride"", ""anti-cancer mechanism"", and ""nanoparticulate delivery system"" as search words, then summarized the progress in research, illustrating the need to explore reprogramming of cancer cell metabolism using nanoparticulate drug delivery systems.With increasing research on regulation of cancer cell metabolism by berberine hydrochloride and troubleshooting of issues concerning nanoparticulate delivery preparation, berberine hydrochloride is likely to become a natural component of the nanoparticulate delivery systems used for cancer therapy. Meanwhile, the known mechanisms of berberine hydrochloride, such as decreased multidrug resistance and enhanced sensitivity of chemotherapeutic drugs, along with improvement in patient quality of life, could also provide new insights into cancer cell metabolism and nanoparticulate delivery preparation.","Animals, Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic, Berberine, Drug Delivery Systems, Glucose, Humans, Lipid Metabolism, Liposomes, Medicine, Chinese Traditional, Nanomedicine, Nanoparticles, Neoplasms",no,no,Unknown,yes,EA,21931477.0, Berberine hydrochloride: anticancer activity and nanoparticulate delivery system ,no,no,no,ea,,False
35219959,Shenqi compound ameliorates type-2 diabetes mellitus by modulating the gut microbiota and metabolites,"The gut microbiota (GM) and metabolites are important factors in mediating the development of type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). An imbalance in the gut microbiota and metabolites can disrupt the function of the intestinal barrier, cause changes in the permeability of the intestinal mucosa and promote the immune inflammatory response, thereby aggravating the fluctuation of blood glucose level and promoting the occurrence and development of the chronic complications of DM. Manipulating the GM and metabolites is a promising therapeutic intervention and is being studied extensively. Shenqi compound (SQC) is a traditional Chinese medicine formulation, which has been widely used to improve T2DM. Studies have demonstrated that SQC can reduce glycemic variability, alleviate the inflammatory response, etc. However, its underlying mechanism remains unknown. Therefore, in this experiment, We administered SQC to Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats and evaluated its effect on blood glucose homeostasis and the intestinal mucosal barrier. We identified the profiles of the GM and metabolites with the aid of 16S rDNA gene sequencing and non-target metabolomics analysis. It showed that SQC intervention could reduce glycemic variability, regulate serum levels of glucagon and insulin, and improve injury to the intestinal mucosal barrier of GK rats. In the gut, the ratio of bacteria of the phyla Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes could be improved after SQC intervention. SQC also regulated the relative abundance of Prevotellaceae, Butyricimonas, Bacteroides, Blautia, Roseburia, Lactobacillus, and Rothia. We found out that expression of 40 metabolites was significantly improved after SQC intervention. Further analyses of metabolic pathways indicated that the therapeutic effect of SQC might be related predominantly to its ability to improve gluconeogenesis/glycolysis, amino acid metabolism, lipid metabolism, citrate cycle, and butanoate metabolism. These results suggest that SQC may exert a beneficial role in T2DM by modulating the GM and metabolites in different pathways.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

25698246,Metabolomic and lipidomic study of the protective effect of Chaihuang-Yishen formula on rats with diabetic nephropathy,"Chaihuang-Yishen formula (CHYS) is a Chinese herbal formula that has been shown clinically to effectively treat chronic kidney disease including diabetic nephropathy (DN), also known as diabetic kidney disease. Our previous animal studies showed that numerous intrarenal metabolites were associated with the development of DN. In the present work, an integrated metabolomic and lipidomic analysis was used to further examine whether CHYS could attenuate the development of DN by regulating the disordered metabolic pathways.Progressive diabetic kidney disease was induced in Wistar rats by uninephrectomy and a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozocin. Over 20 weeks, one group of animals was treated with CHYS and another group went untreated. Effects of CHYS on metabolomic and lipidomic changes in the renal cortex of diabetic rats were studied using gas chromatography/time-of-flight mass spectrometry, ultra-performance liquid chromatography/time-of-flight mass spectrometry, and tandem MS-based metabolomic and lipidomic. The well-established drug fosinopril was used as positive control throughout the experiment.Like fosinopril, treatment with CHYS produced a renoprotective effect against DN. Metabolomic and lipidomic analyses showed that the therapeutic effect of CHYS on DN was significantly associated with inhibition of the elevated organic toxins including several uremic toxins and glucuronides, and normalization of diminished phospholipids, especially sphingomyelins.Improved abnormal metabolic and lipidomic disorders, such as accumulation of uremic toxins and glucuronides and phospholipids, may be mechanisms by which treatment of CHYS inhibits DN. Results from this study provide new evidence for the pharmacologic characteristics of CHYS on DN.Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

34159207,Network Pharmacology and Molecular Docking Study on the Potential Mechanism of Yi-Qi-Huo-Xue-Tong-Luo Formula in Treating Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy,"To investigate the potential mechanism of action of Yi-Qi-Huo-Xue-Tong-Luo formula (YQHXTLF) in the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN).Network pharmacology and molecular docking techniques were used in this study. Firstly, the active ingredients and the corresponding targets of YQHXTLF were retrieved using the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology (TCMSP) platform; subsequently, the targets related to DPN were retrieved using GeneCards, Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM), Pharmgkb, Therapeutic Target Database (TTD) and Drugbank databases; the common targets of YQHXTLF and DPN were obtained by Venn diagram; afterwards, the ""YQHXTLF Pharmacodynamic Component-DPN Target"" regulatory network was visualized using Cytoscape 3.6.1 software, and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis were performed on the potential targets using R 3.6.3 software. Finally, molecular docking of the main chemical components in the PPI network with the core targets was verified by Autodock Vina software.A total of 86 active ingredients and 229 targets in YQHXTLF were screened, and 81 active ingredients and 110 targets were identified to be closely related to diabetic peripheral neuropathy disease. PPI network mapping identified TP53, MAPK1, JUN, and STAT3 as possible core targets. KEGG pathway analysis showed that these targets are mostly involved in AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications, TNF signaling pathway, and MAPK signaling pathway. The molecular docking results showed that the main chemical components of YQHXTLF have a stable binding activity to the core pivotal targets.YQHXTLF may act on TP53, MAPK1, JUN, and STAT3 to regulate inflammatory response, apoptosis, or proliferation as a molecular mechanism for the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathy, reflecting its multitarget and multipathway action, and providing new ideas to further uncover its pharmacological basis and mechanism of action.Copyright © 2021 Yixuan Lin et al.","Angelica sinensis, Astragalus Plant, Chrysanthemum, Diabetic Neuropathies, Dioscorea, Drugs, Chinese Herbal, Glycation End Products, Advanced, Humans, Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1, Molecular Docking Simulation, Network Pharmacology, Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun, Pueraria, Receptor for Advanced Glycation End Products, STAT3 Transcription Factor, Signal Transduction, Tumor Suppressor Protein p53",yes,yes,Unknown,yes,EA,34159207.0, Network Pharmacology and Molecular Docking Study on the Potential Mechanism of Yi-Qi-Huo-Xue-Tong-Luo Formula in Treating Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy ,no,yes,yes,ea,,False

34053528,Integrated metabolomics and 16S rDNA sequencing to investigate the mechanism of immune-enhancing effect of health Tonic oral liquid,"Health Tonic oral liquid (HT) is a popular functional food in China and is used to enhance host immune response. However, its mechanisms of action are still poorly understood. In this work, we combined ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q/TOF MS) serum metabolomics with 16S rDNA sequencing to evaluate the effects of HT on metabolomics profiling and microbial community signatures. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) contents in fecal were quantified through gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Results indicated that HT use leads to a significant increase in IgG, IgM and IgA. Thirty-four metabolites were identified and quantified using metabolomics, most were aromatic amino acids and metabolites involved in glucose metabolism. HT intervention significantly increased the abundance of Alloprevotella, which may contribute to intestinal barrier integrity and inflammatory response inhabitation. Most SCFAs were highly expressed following HT intake. In summary, HT use maintains glucose and lipid metabolism balance, promotes high expressions of beneficial bacteria, and exerts promising immunomodulatory effects.Copyright Â© 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

35716918,"Integrative pharmacology reveals the mechanisms of Erzhi Pill, a traditional Chinese formulation, against diabetic cardiomyopathy","Erzhi Pill (EZP) is a traditional Chinese prescription that has marked effects in treating type 2 diabetes mellitus and diabetic nephropathy. However, its underlying pharmacological mechanisms in the treatment of diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM), remain to be elucidated.This study aimed to apply an integrative pharmacological strategy to systematically evaluate the pharmacological effects and molecular mechanisms of EZP, and provide a solid theoretical basis for the clinical application of EZP in the treatment of DCM.In this study, the potential targets and key pathways of EZP were predicted and validated using network pharmacology and molecular docking, respectively. Changes in cardiac metabolites and major metabolic pathways in rat heart samples were examined using 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) metabolomics. Finally, biochemical analysis was conducted to detect the protein expression levels of key pathways.We found that EZP decreased fasting blood glucose (FBG), triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, increased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels in the serum, and alleviated the morphological abnormalities of the heart tissue in diabetic rats. Furthermore, EZP effectively restored superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9 activity levels, as well as the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), B-cell lymphoma (Bcl)-2, and Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) in the heart tissue. Network pharmacology prediction results indicated that the mechanism of EZP in treating DCM was closely related to apoptosis, oxidative stress, and the HIF-1, PI3K-Akt, and FoxO signaling pathways. In addition, 1H-NMR metabolomics confirmed that EZP primarily regulated both energy metabolism and amino acid metabolism, including the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, ketone bodies metabolism, glutamine and glutamate metabolism, glycine metabolism, and purine metabolism. Finally, immunohistochemistry results indicated that EZP reduced the expression levels of p-AMPK, p-PI3K, p-Akt, and p-FoxO3a proteins, in the heart tissue of DCM rats.The results confirmed that the overall therapeutic effect of EZP in the DCM rat model is exerted via inhibition of oxidative stress and apoptosis, alongside the regulation of energy metabolism and amino acid metabolism, as well as the AMPK and PI3K/Akt/FoxO3a signaling pathways. This study provides an experimental basis for the use of EZP in DCM treatment.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

32096754,Exploring the Protective Effect of ShenQi Compound on Skeletal Muscle in Diabetic Macrovasculopathy Mice,"ShenQi compound (SQC) is a traditional herbal formula, which has been used to treat Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and complications for years. The aim of this study was to explore the preventive and protective effects of SQC recipe on the skeletal muscle of diabetic macrovasculopathy mice, which provides a theoretical basis for the clinical use of this formula.We evaluated the effect of SQC in a diabetic vasculopathy mouse model by detecting a series of blood indicators (blood glucose, lipids and insulin) and performing histological observations. Meanwhile, we explored the molecular mechanism of SQC treatment on skeletal muscle by genome expression profiles.The results indicated that SQC could effectively improve blood glucose, serum lipids (total cholesterol (TC), Triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)) and insulin (INS) levels in diabetic vasculopathy mice, as well as alleviating skeletal muscle tissue damage for diabetic macrovasculopathy. Meanwhile, compared with rosiglitazone, SQC showed a better effect on blood glucose fluctuation. Moreover, the gene microarray analysis indicated that SQC might improve T2DM by affecting biological functions related to cell death and cell adhesion. Moreover, 7 genes (Celsr2, Rilpl1, Dlx6as, 2010004M13Rik, Anapc13, Gm6097, Ddx39b) might be potential therapeutic targets of SQC.All these results indicate that SQC is an effective preventive and protective drug for skeletal muscle in diabetic macrovasculopathy, and could alleviate skeletal muscle tissue damage through affecting biological functions related to cell death and cell adhesion.CopyrightÂ© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.","Animals, Blood Glucose, Cytoprotection, Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2, Diabetic Angiopathies, Drugs, Chinese Herbal, Gene Expression, Gene Expression Profiling, Male, Medicine, Chinese Traditional, Mice, Muscle, Skeletal, Phytotherapy",no,yes,Unknown,yes,EA,32096754.0, Exploring the Protective Effect of ShenQi Compound on Skeletal Muscle in Diabetic Macrovasculopathy Mice ,yes,yes,yes,ea,,False
26666414,Genomic and transcriptomic analyses of the Chinese Maotai-flavored liquor yeast MT1 revealed its unique multi-carbon co-utilization,"Revealing genetic mechanisms behind specific physiological characteristics of Saccharomyces cerevisiae from specific environments is important for industrial applications and requires precise understanding.Maotai strain MT1 was isolated from the complicated Chinese Maotai-flavored liquor-making environment with extremely high temperatures, and acidic and ethanol stresses. Compared with the type strain S288c, MT1 can tolerate high acidity (pH 2.0), high ethanol levels (16 %) and high temperatures (44 Â°C). In addition, MT1 can simultaneously utilize various sugars, including glucose, sucrose, galactose, maltose, melibiose, trehalose, raffinose and turanose. Genomic comparisons identified a distinct MT1 genome, 0.5 Mb smaller than that of S288c. There are 145 MT1-specific genes that are not in S288c, including MEL1, MAL63, KHR1, BIO1 and BIO6. A transcriptional comparison indicated that HXT5 and HXT13, which are theoretically repressed by glucose, were no longer inhibited in MT1 and were highly expressed even in a medium containing 70 g/L glucose. Thus, other sugars may be co-utilized with glucose by MT1 without diauxic growth.Based on a functional genomics analysis, we revealed the genetic basis and evolutionary mechanisms underlying the traits of the Chinese Maotai-flavored yeast MT1.

27995148,Investigation of the Effects and Mechanisms of Mai Tong Formula on Lower Limb Macroangiopathy in a Spontaneous Diabetic Rat Model,"A new Chinese herbal formula called Mai Tong Formulae (MTF) has recently been used to treat lower limb macroangiopathy in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients. In this study, we investigated the effect of MTF on lower limb macroangiopathy in a spontaneous diabetic rat model (GK rats). We found that MTF treatment significantly reduced serum fasting blood glucose (FBG), triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), IL6, and VEGF and increased serum insulin in this model. Histological and ultrastructural observations showed that MTF treatment significantly reduced vascular endothelial cell shedding and improved endothelium injuries. We further detect proteome alteration following MTF treatment. 25 differential proteins (DPs) abnormally expressed in GK rats were normalized by MTF treatment. These DPs significantly are enriched in biological processes and pathways that regulate muscle contraction and cGMP-PKG signaling pathway and so on. Additional protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analyses of the DPs showed that Fasn and Prkar2a are involved in the AMPK signaling pathway, and Gnas, Myh11, and Myh6 are involved in vascular smooth muscle contraction; these 5 DPs were validated by Western blotting. These results indicate that MTF treatment effectively treats lower limb macroangiopathy by regulating key proteins involved in AMPK signaling pathway and vascular smooth muscle contraction.","Animals, Animals, Inbred Strains, Blood Glucose, Blotting, Western, Cholesterol, Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid, Diabetes Mellitus, Diabetic Angiopathies, Disease Models, Animal, Drugs, Chinese Herbal, Female, Femoral Artery, Lower Extremity, Proteomics, Rats, Triglycerides",no,yes,Unknown,yes,EA,27995148.0, Investigation of the Effects and Mechanisms of Mai Tong Formula on Lower Limb Macroangiopathy in a Spontaneous Diabetic Rat Model ,yes,yes,yes,ea,,False

In this study, network analysis was performed to decipher the molecular mechanisms of GSZ in the treatment of DPN.The chemical components of the 3 herbs forming GSZ, ie, Ramulus Cinnamomi (Guizhi), Paeonia lactiflora (Shaoyao) and Rhizoma Anemarrhenae (Zhimu), were searched in Chinese medicine dictionaries, and their target proteins were identified in PubChem. DPN genes were searched in PubMed gene databases. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) was used to build the GSZ pharmacological network and DPN molecular network. The canonical pathways between the two networks were compared to decipher the molecular mechanisms of GSZ in the treatment of DPN.Sixty-one protein targets for Guizhi, 31 targets for Shaoyao, 47 targets for Zhimu, as well as 23 genes related to DPN were identified and uploaded to IPA. The primary functions of the DPN molecular network were inflammatory response, metabolic disease, cellular assembly and organization. As far as the pharmacological network functions were concerned, Guizhi target proteins were involved in neurological disease, inflammatory disease, cellular growth and proliferation, cell signaling, molecular transport, and nucleic acid metabolism, Shaoyao target proteins were related to neurological disease, inflammatory disease, and Zhimu target proteins focused on cell death and survival, cellular movement, immune cell trafficking, DNA replication, recombination and repair, and cell cycle. In the three-herb combination GSZ, several new network functions were revealed, including the inflammatory response, gene expression, connective tissue development and function, endocrine system disorders, and metabolic disease. The canonical pathway comparison showed that Shaoyao focused on IL-12 signaling and production in macrophages, and Zhimu focused on TNFR2 signaling, death receptor signaling, ILK signaling, IL-17A in gastric cells, IL-6 signaling, IL-8 signaling, the role of JAK1, JAK2, and TYK2 in interferon signaling, IL-9 signaling, HMGB1 signaling, NO production and ROS production in macrophages, whereas GSZ focused aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling and apoptosis signaling in addition to those pathways induced by Guizhi, Shaoyao and Zhimu.Although each single herb can affect some DPN-related functions and pathways, GSZ exerts more effects on DPN-related functions and pathways. The effects of GSZ on aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling and apoptosis signaling pathways may be the key components of its total molecular mechanisms.","Animals, Cluster Analysis, Data Mining, Databases, Genetic, Diabetic Neuropathies, Drug Combinations, Drugs, Chinese Herbal, Gene Expression Regulation, Gene Regulatory Networks, Genomics, Humans, Medicine, Chinese Traditional, Peripheral Nervous System Diseases, Protein Interaction Maps, Signal Transduction, Systems Biology, Systems Integration, Treatment Outcome",no,yes,Unknown,yes,EA,25948477.0," Molecular network-based analysis of guizhi-shaoyao-zhimu decoction, a TCM herbal formula, for treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathy ",yes,yes,yes,ea,,False

The shell of Trapa bispinosa has anticancer activity, maybe due to its high content of polyphenols. There are few studies on the chemical composition of Trapa bispinosa shells, then we isolated the active components from Trapa bispinosa shell and clarified the mechanism of its anticancer activity. One monomer compound was separated from the ethanol extract of the Trapa bispinosa shell by fractional extraction, silica gel, Sephadex LH-20 gel column chromatography and liquid phase separation. The structure, identified by NMR was 1,2,3,6-tetra-O-galloyl-Î²-D-glucose. The results of the CCK-8 assay showed that 1,2,3,6-tetra-O-galloyl-Î²-D-glucose could significantly inhibit the proliferation of gastric cancer SGC7901 cells, and the effect was close to that of 5-fluorouracil. Here, 1,2,3,6-tetra-O-galloyl-Î²-D-glucose could affect the cell cycle of SGC7901 cells. At the dose of 200 Î¼g/mL and an incubation time of 48 h, SGC7901 cells remained in the G1 phase, apoptosis occurred, the intracellular calcium ion concentration increased and the mitochondrial membrane potential decreased. Transcriptome sequencing analysis showed that the differentially expressed genes were mainly enriched in the P53 signalling pathway associated with apoptosis. The results of qPCR and Western blot showed that 1,2,3,6-tetra-O-galloyl-Î²-D-glucose could induce apoptosis of SGC7901 cells by up-regulating the expression levels of P21, PUMA, PERP and IGF-BP3 genes, down-regulating the CyclinD gene, increasing the expression levels of cytochrome C, caspase-3, caspase-9 protein and decreasing that of the protein BCL-2.","Apoptosis, Glucose, Humans, Plant Extracts, Polyphenols, Stomach Neoplasms",no,no,Unknown,yes,EA,35653387.0," Molecular mechanism of the anti-gastric cancer activity of 1,2,3,6-tetra-O-galloyl-beta-D-glucose isolated from Trapa bispinosa Roxb. shell in vitro ",no,no,yes,ea,,False

The traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) complex prescription Tongfengxiaofang (TFXF) is composed of a variety of TCMs. To study the therapeutic effect of TFXF on HUM mice and the mechanisms by which it exerts a therapeutic effect, the biochemical indices were measured and qPCR technique was used. In addition, plasma metabolomics analysis was carried out based on UPLC-Q-TOF/MS to evaluate the characteristics of the metabolic spectrum changes. TFXF significantly downregulated the contents of uric acid, urea nitrogen and creatinine in serum and the concentration of xanthine oxidase in liver of HUM mice. In addition, TFXF significantly inhibited the overexpression of uric acid transporter 1 and glucose transporter 9 and upregulated the expression of organic anion transporter 1 in the kidney. A total of 152 metabolites were identified and 11 key biomarkers were further selected from these pathways to understand the mechanism of TFXF on the arginine biosynthesis, galactose metabolism, pyrimidine metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism, tryptophan metabolism and the citrate cycle (TCA cycle).

31238257,GC/MS-based metabonomics approach reveals effects of Xuebijing injection in CLP induced septic rats,"Xuebijing (XBJ) injection, a Chinese traditional medicine injection, is widely used in the treatment of sepsis in China, and shows a promising clinical therapeutic effect. However, its impacts on the metabolic changes of sepsis have not yet been reported. We established a septic rat model using cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) and treated with XBJ or placebo (saline). The survival rates were monitored for 7d, the effects of XBJ on liver and kidney tissue morphology, serum biochemistry [alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine (Cr)] and cytokines [tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-Î±) and interleukin 6 (IL-6)] production were assessed. Plasma samples were profiled by gas chromatography/mass spectrometer (GC/MS) and analyzed to evaluate the metabolites changes. We found that XBJ can increase the survival rate of septic rats by reducing multi-organ dysfunctions shown as decrease in serum biochemistry indicators, cytokines, and morphologic changes. A Partial Least-Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) score plot indicated that rats undergo significant metabolic changes between the three groups. 21 distinct metabolites with VIP>1.5 and p<0.05 were were identified between these group.

33883881,Network Pharmacology Analysis of ZiShenWan for Diabetic Nephropathy and Experimental Verification of Its Anti-Inflammatory Mechanism,"Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The inflammatory response plays a critical role in DN. ZiShenWan (ZSW) is a classical Chinese medicinal formula with remarkable clinical therapeutic effects on DN, but its pharmacological action mechanisms remain unclear.In this study, a network pharmacology approach was applied to investigate the pharmacological mechanisms of ZSW in DN therapy. Based on the results of network analysis, the core targets and signaling pathways related to anti-inflammatory effect were verified via experiments in vivo.The candidate chemical ingredients of ZSW as well as its putative targets and known therapeutic targets of DN were acquired from appropriate databases. The ""herb-ingredient-target"" network for ZSW in DN treatment was established. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of potential targets was constructed to screen the core targets. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were performed. In addition to biochemical and pathological indicators, the core targets and signaling pathways associated with inflammation were partially validated in db/db mice at molecular level.A total of 56 active ingredients in ZSW and 166 DN-related targets were selected from databases. A high proportion of core targets and top signaling pathways participate in inflammation. ZSW markedly alleviated renal injuries pathologically and regulated related biomarkers. In particular, ZSW significantly inhibited the exaggerated release of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1Î², IL-6, tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNF)-É‘, and monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1 as well as regulating p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-protein kinase B (Akt) signaling pathways in db/db mice.This study first comprehensively investigated the active ingredients, potential targets, and molecular mechanism of ZSW as a therapy for DN. ZSW achieved renoprotective effects in DN via regulation of multiple targets and signaling pathways, especially by alleviating inflammation. Results indicate that ZSW is a promising multi-target therapeutic approach for DN treatment.Â© 2021 Guo et al.","Administration, Oral, Animals, Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Cytokines, Diabetic Nephropathies, Disease Models, Animal, Drugs, Chinese Herbal, Inflammation, Male, Mice, Mice, Inbred C57BL, Signal Transduction",no,yes,Unknown,yes,EA,33883881.0, Network Pharmacology Analysis of ZiShenWan for Diabetic Nephropathy and Experimental Verification of Its Anti-Inflammatory Mechanism ,no,yes,yes,ea,,False
32636751,(1)H NMR-Based Metabolomics Coupled With Molecular Docking Reveal the Anti-Diabetic Effects and Potential Active Components of Berberis vernae on Type 2 Diabetic Rats,"The dried stem bark of Berberis vernae C.K.Schneid., known as ""Xiao-bo-pi"" in Chinese, is a representative anti-diabetic herb in traditional Tibetan medical system. However, its anti-diabetic mechanisms and active components remain unclear. In this study, 1H NMR-based metabolomics, biochemistry assay, molecular docking, and network analysis were integrated to evaluate the anti-diabetic effects of B. vernae extract on type 2 diabetic rats, and to explore its active components and underlying mechanisms. Diabetes was induced by high-fat diet and streptozotocin. After 30 days of treatment, B. vernae extract significantly decreased the serum levels of fasting blood glucose, insulin, insulin resistance index, glycated serum protein, TNF-Î±, IL-1Î², and IL-6, whereas significantly increased the serum levels of insulin sensitivity index in type 2 diabetic rats. A total of 28 endogenous metabolites were identified by 1H NMR-based metabolomics, of which 9 metabolites that were changed by diabetes were significantly reversed by B. vernae extract. The constructed compound-protein-metabolite-disease (CPMD) interaction network revealed the correlation between chemical constituents, target proteins, differential metabolites, and type 2 diabetes. Ferulic acid 4-O-Î²-D-glucopyranoside, bufotenidine, jatrorrhizine, and berberine showed good hit rates for both the 30 disease-related proteins and 14 differential metabolites-related proteins, indicating that these four compounds might be the active ingredients of B. vernae against type 2 diabetes. Moreover, pathway analysis revealed that the anti-diabetic mechanisms of B. vernae might be related to its regulation of several metabolic pathways (e.g., butanoate metabolism) and disease-related signal pathways (e.g., adipocytokine signaling pathway). In summary, B. vernae exerts a significant anti-diabetic effect and has potential as a drug candidate for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.Copyright Â© 2020 Li, Zhao, Zhang, Du, Xu, Xu, Zhang, Kuang, Lai, Fan and Zhang.",,no,yes,Unknown,yes,EA,32636751.0, (1)H NMR-Based Metabolomics Coupled With Molecular Docking Reveal the Anti-Diabetic Effects and Potential Active Components of Berberis vernae on Type 2 Diabetic Rats ,yes,yes,yes,ea,,False

33204295,A Network Pharmacology to Explore the Mechanism of Astragalus Membranaceus in the Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy,"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) includes a series of typical lesions affected by retinal microvascular damage caused by diabetes mellitus (DM), which not only seriously damages the vision, affecting the life's quality of patients, but also brings a considerable burden to the family and society. Astragalus Membranaceus (AM) is a commonly used medicine in clinical therapy of eye disorders in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). In recent years, it is also used for treating DR, but the specific mechanism is unclear. Therefore, this study explores the potential mechanism of AM in DR treatment by using network pharmacology.Based on the oral bioavailability (OB) and drug likeness (DL) of two ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion) parameters, Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database (TCMSP), Swiss Target Prediction platform, GeneCards, and OMIM database were used to predict and screen the active compounds of AM, the core targets of AM in DR treatment. The Metascape data platform was used to perform Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis on the core targets.24 active compounds were obtained, such as quercetin, kaempferol, and astragaloside IV. There were 169 effective targets of AM in DR treatment, and the targets were further screened and finally, 38 core targets were obtained, such as VEGFA, AKT1, and IL-6. EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance, AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, and other metabolic pathways participated in oxidative stress, cell apoptosis, angiogenesis signal transduction, inflammation, and other biological processes.AM treats DR through multiple compounds, multiple targets, and multiple pathways. AM may play a role in the treatment of DR by targeting VEGFA, AKT1, and IL-6 and participating in oxidative stress, angiogenesis, and inflammation.Copyright Â© 2020 Qi Jin et al.",,no,yes,Unknown,yes,EA,33204295.0, A Network Pharmacology to Explore the Mechanism of Astragalus Membranaceus in the Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy ,no,yes,yes,ea,,False
31080482,Hirsutella sinensis Treatment Shows Protective Effects on Renal Injury and Metabolic Modulation in db/db Mice,"Hirsutella sinensis (HS) is the anamorph of the traditional Chinese medicine Cordyceps sinensis. Although the renal protective effect of HS has been reported, its effect on diabetic nephropathy (DN) remains unclear. In this study, db/db mice were used as the DN model, and the renal protective effect was evaluated after oral administration of HS for 6 and 12 weeks. Plasma, urine, and kidney samples were collected, and biochemical indicator measurements, pathological analysis, and metabolomics studies were performed. Biochemical assays showed that HS reduced the levels of fasting blood glucose (FBG), urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR), and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) and increased the creatinine clearance (Ccr). HS alleviated glomerular and tubular glycogen accumulation and fibrosis and normalized the disordered ultrastructure of the glomerular filtration barrier. Metabolomics analysis of metabolites in the plasma, urine, and kidney indicated that HS modulated the perturbed glycolipid metabolism and amino acid turnover. HS reduced the elevated levels of metabolites involved in energy metabolism (TCA cycle, glycolysis, and pentose phosphate pathway) and nucleotide metabolism (pyrimidine metabolism and purine metabolism) in the kidneys of db/db mice. These results suggest that HS can protect against renal injury and that its efficacy involved metabolic modulation of the disturbed metabolome in db/db mice.",,no,no,Unknown,yes,EA,31080482.0, Hirsutella sinensis Treatment Shows Protective Effects on Renal Injury and Metabolic Modulation in db/db Mice ,yes,yes,yes,ea,,False
36099982,A unique insight for Xiaoyao San exerts antidepressant effects by modulating hippocampal glucose catabolism using stable isotope-resolved metabolomics,"In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) theory, depression is an emotional disease, which is thought to be related to stagnation of liver qi and dysfunction of the spleen in transport. Xiaoyao San (XYS) is considered to have the effects of soothing liver-qi stagnation and invigorating the spleen. The spleen has the function to transport and transform nutrients. The liver has also termed the center of energy metabolism in the body. Therefore, exploring the antidepressant effects of XYS from the perspective of energy metabolism may reveal new findings.Glucose catabolism is an important part of energy metabolism. In recent years, several researchers have found that XYS can exert antidepressant effects by modulating abnormalities in glucose catabolism-related metabolites. The previous research of our research group found that the hippocampus glucose catabolism was disordered in depression. However, the antidepressant potential of XYS through modulating the disorders of hippocampal glucose catabolism and the specific metabolic pathways and targets of XYS action were still unknown. The aim of this study was to address the above scientific questions.In this research, the CUMS (chronic unpredictable mild stress) model was used as the animal model of depression. The antidepressant effect of XYS was evaluated by behavioral indicators. The specific pathways and targets of XYS modulating the disorders of glucose catabolism in the hippocampus of CUMS rats were obtained by stable isotope-resolved metabolomics. Further, the isotope tracing results were also verified by molecular biology and electron transmission electron microscopy.The results demonstrated that XYS pretreatment could significantly improve the depressive symptoms induced by CUMS. More importantly, it was found that XYS could modulate the disorders of glucose catabolism in the hippocampus of CUMS rats. Stable isotope-resolved metabolomics and enzyme activity tests showed that Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), Pyruvate carboxylase (PC), and Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) were targets of XYS for modulating the disorders of glucose catabolism in the hippocampus of CUMS rats. The Succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) and mitochondrial respiratory chain complex V (MRCC-Ⅴ) were targets of XYS to improve abnormal mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in the hippocampus of CUMS rats. XYS was also found to have the ability to improve the structural damage of mitochondria and nuclei in the hippocampal caused by CUMS.This study was to explore the antidepressant effect of XYS from the perspective of glucose catabolism based on a strategy combining stable isotope tracing, molecular biology techniques, and transmission electron microscopy. We not only obtained the specific pathways and targets of XYS to improve the disorders of glucose catabolism in the hippocampus of CUMS rats, but also revealed the specific targets of the pathways of XYS compared with VLF.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

32374863,Comparative Metabolome and Transcriptome Analyses of Susceptible Asparagus officinalis and Resistant Wild A. kiusianus Reveal Insights into Stem Blight Disease Resistance,"Phomopsis asparagi is one of the most serious fungal pathogens, which causes stem blight disease in Asparagus officinalis (AO), adversely affecting its production worldwide. Recently, the development of novel asparagus varieties using wild Asparagus genetic resources with natural P. asparagi resistance has become a priority in Japan due to the lack of resistant commercial AO cultivars. In this study, comparative metabolome and transcriptome analyses of susceptible AO and resistant wild Asparagus kiusianus (AK) 24 and 48â€‰h postinoculated (AOI_24 hpi, AOI_48 hpi, AKI_24 hpi and AKI_48 hpi, respectively) with P. asparagi were conducted to gain insights into metabolic and expression changes associated with AK species. Following infection, the resistant wild AK showed rapid metabolic changes with increased levels of flavonoids and steroidal saponins and decreased asparagusic acid glucose ester content, compared with the susceptible AO plants. Transcriptome data revealed a total of 21â€‰ differentially expressed genes (DEGs) as the core gene set that displayed upregulation in the resistant AK versus susceptible AO after infection with P. asparagi. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis of these DEGs identified 11 significantly enriched pathways, including flavonoid biosynthesis and primary metabolite metabolism, in addition to plant signaling and defense-related pathways. In addition, comparative single-nucleotide polymorphism and Indel distributions in susceptible AO and resistant AK plants were evaluated using the latest AO reference genome Aspof.V1. The data generated in this study are important resources for advancing Asparagus breeding programs and for investigations of genetic linkage mapping, phylogenetic diversity and plant defense-related genes.Â© The Author(s) 2020.

36005580,NMR Metabolomics in Serum Fingerprinting of Schizophrenia Patients in a Serbian Cohort,"Schizophrenia is a widespread mental disorder that leads to significant functional impairments and premature death. The state of the art indicates gaps in the understanding and diagnosis of this disease, but also the need for personalized and precise approaches to patients through customized medical treatment and reliable monitoring of treatment response. In order to fulfill existing gaps, the establishment of a universal set of disorder biomarkers is a necessary step. Metabolomic investigations of serum samples of Serbian patients with schizophrenia (51) and healthy controls (39), based on NMR analyses associated with chemometrics, led to the identification of 26 metabolites/biomarkers for this disorder. Principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) models with prediction accuracies of 0.9718 and higher were accomplished during chemometric analysis. The established biomarker set includes aspartate/aspartic acid, lysine, 2-hydroxybutyric acid, and acylglycerols, which are identified for the first time in schizophrenia serum samples by NMR experiments. The other 22 identified metabolites in the Serbian samples are in accordance with the previously established NMR-based serum biomarker sets of Brazilian and/or Chinese patient samples. Thirteen metabolites (lactate/lactic acid, threonine, leucine, isoleucine, valine, glutamine, asparagine, alanine, gamma-aminobutyric acid, choline, glucose, glycine and tyrosine) that are common for three different ethnic and geographic origins (Serbia, Brazil and China) could be a good start point for the setup of a universal NMR serum biomarker set for schizophrenia.",,no,no,ea,yes,EA,36005580.0, NMR Metabolomics in Serum Fingerprinting of Schizophrenia Patients in a Serbian Cohort ,yes,no,yes,cee,,False
28496003,Peiminine inhibits colorectal cancer cell proliferation by inducing apoptosis and autophagy and modulating key metabolic pathways,"Peiminine, a compound extracted from the bulbs of Fritillaria thunbergii and traditionally used as a medication in China and other Asian countries, was reported to inhibit colorectal cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth by inducing autophagic cell death. However, its mechanism of anticancer action is not well understood, especially at the metabolic level, which was thought to primarily account for peiminine's efficacy against cancer. Using an established metabolomic profiling platform combining ultra-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, we identified metabolic alterations in colorectal cancer cell line HCT-116 after peiminine treatment. Among the identified 236 metabolites, the levels of 57 of them were significantly (p < 0.05) different between peiminine-treated and -untreated cells in which 45 metabolites were increased and the other 12 metabolites were decreased. Several of the affected metabolites, including glucose, glutamine, oleate (18:1n9), and lignocerate (24:0), may be involved in regulation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway and in the oxidative stress response upon peiminine exposure. Peiminine predominantly modulated the pathways responsible for metabolism of amino acids, carbohydrates, and lipids. Collectively, these results provide new insights into the mechanisms by which peiminine modulates metabolic pathways to inhibit colorectal cancer cell growth, supporting further exploration of peiminine as a potential new strategy for treating colorectal cancer.","Animals, Antineoplastic Agents, Apoptosis, Cell Line, Tumor, Cell Proliferation, Cell Survival, Cevanes, Colorectal Neoplasms, Energy Metabolism, HCT116 Cells, Humans, Metabolic Networks and Pathways, Metabolome, Metabolomics, Mice",no,no,Unknown,yes,EA,28496003.0, Peiminine inhibits colorectal cancer cell proliferation by inducing apoptosis and autophagy and modulating key metabolic pathways ,yes,no,yes,ea,,False

29769702,Fine-mapping of 98 obesity loci in Mexican children,"Mexico has one of the highest prevalence of childhood obesity in the world. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for obesity have identified multiple single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in populations of European, East Asian, and African descent. The contribution of these loci to obesity in Mexican children is unclear. We assessed the transferability of 98 obesity loci in Mexican children and fine-mapped the association signals.The study included 405 and 390 Mexican children with normal weight and obesity. Participants were genotyped with a genome-wide dense SNP array designed for Latino populations, allowing for the analysis of GWAS index SNPs as well as fine-mapping SNPs, totaling 750 SNPs covering 98 loci. Two genetic risk scores (GRS) were constructed: a ""discovery GRS"" and a ""best-associated GRS"", representing the number of effect alleles at the GWAS index SNPs and at the best-associated SNPs after fine-mapping for each subject.Seventeen obesity loci were significantly associated with obesity, and five had fine-mapping SNPs significantly better associated with obesity than their corresponding GWAS index SNPs in Mexican children. Six obesity-associated SNPs significantly departed from additive to dominant (Nâ€‰=â€‰5) or recessive (Nâ€‰=â€‰1) models, and a significant interaction was found between rs274609 (TNNI3K) and rs1010553 (ITIH4) on childhood obesity risk. The best-associated GRS was significantly more associated with childhood obesity (ORâ€‰=â€‰1.21 per additional risk allele [95%CI:1.17-1.25], Pâ€‰=â€‰4.8â€‰Ã—â€‰10-25) than the discovery GRS (ORâ€‰=â€‰1.05 per additional risk allele [95%CI:1.02-1.08], Pâ€‰=â€‰8.0â€‰Ã—â€‰10-4), and was also associated with waist-to-hip ratio, fasting glucose, fasting insulin and triglyceride levels, the association being mediated by obesity. An overall depletion of obesity risk alleles was observed in Mexican children with normal weight when compared to GWAS discovery populations.Our study indicates a partial transferability of GWAS obesity loci in Mexican children, and supports the pertinence of post-GWAS fine-mapping experiments in the admixed Mexican population.","Adolescent, Child, Fasting, Female, Gene Frequency, Genetic Loci, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, Genome-Wide Association Study, Humans, Life Style, Male, Mexico, Obesity, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide, Socioeconomic Factors",yes,no,ea,yes,EA,29769702.0, Fine-mapping of 98 obesity loci in Mexican children ,yes,no,yes,lac,,False
23024142,"Oscillibacter ruminantium sp. nov., isolated from the rumen of Korean native cattle","A strictly anaerobic, Gram-negative, non-spore-forming bacterium, designated GH1(T), was isolated from the rumen of Korean native cattle (HanWoo). Cells were straight to slightly curved rods (2.0-4.5 Âµm long) and were motile by peritrichous flagella. The isolate grew at 30-45 Â°C (optimum 40 Â°C), at pH 5.5-6.5 (optimum pH 6.0) and with up to 3.5% (w/v) NaCl. Strain GH1(T) produced acid from d-glucose, d-ribose and d-xylose, with butyric acid being the major end product. The genomic DNA G+C content was 54.6 mol%.

Over the last decade, small studies have indicated that these agents may also lower glucose levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).This 26-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study was conducted between August 2004 and July 2006 at 54 sites in the United States and 2 in Mexico to determine the effects of colesevelam hydrochloride, a bile acid sequestrant, in patients with inadequately controlled T2DM (hemoglobin A(1c) [HbA(1c)] level, 7.5%-9.5% [baseline HbA(1c) level, 8.1%]), who were receiving metformin monotherapy or metformin combined with additional oral anti-diabetes mellitus drugs. In total, 316 subjects were randomized (159 to colesevelam hydrochloride, 3.75 g/d, and 157 to matching placebo). The primary efficacy parameter was mean placebo-corrected change in HbA(1c) level from baseline to week 26 (analysis was on an intent-to-treat population using a last-observation-carried-forward approach).Colesevelam lowered the mean HbA(1c) level compared with placebo at week 26 (-0.54%; P < .001). Similar results were observed in the metformin monotherapy (-0.47%; P = .002) and combination therapy cohorts (-0.62%; P < .001).

ApoB and fibrinogen were determined by quantitative radial immunodiffusion on agar plates (Diffuplate,BiocientÃ­fica SA,Argentina) and hs-CRP by immunoturbidimetric test. Qualitative variables were compared with the Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test. Quantitative variables were compared applying parametrics or nonparametric tests. Pearson test for correlations. Software SPSS 17.0. 97 patients were analyzed: 69.1% were men. 80% were on antiretroviral treatment. Average (SD) BMI was 24.3 (4.1) kg/m(2). 29.4% were overweight and 5.9% obese. Patients with a BMI â‰¥25.0 kg/m(2) presented significantly higher levels of TG, ApoB and glycemia than well-nourished people [246.1(169.0) vs. 142.9(78.4) mg/dL;p=0.029, 198.6(69.3) vs. 126.4(50.6) mg/dL;p=0.01 and 100 (3.2) vs. 90.2 (6.9) mg/dL;p=0.008 resp.] and a significantly decreased HDL [37.2(1.5) vs. 49.8(10.4) mg/dL;p<0.01]. No statistically significant correlation was found between ApoB and non-HDL (p=0,063). There was no evidence that there is a direct relation between Apo B and the other lipid parameters. The potential increase in CVD in this group of patients, would be related to the higher levels of TG, ApoB and overweight/obesity.

32811197,Brazil nut prevents oxidative DNA damage in type 2 diabetes patients,"The Brazil nut (Bertholletia excelsa, H.B.K.) originating from the Amazon region is one of the richest known sources of selenium (Se), a micronutrient that is essential and required for optimal physiological functioning. This mineral presents several health benefits, including improvement of the redox cellular status and maintenance of genomic stability. Knowing that type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) is strongly linked to oxidative stress and consequently DNA damage, the aim of this study was to assess the ex vivo antioxidative effects of Se through Brazil nut consumption and its potential in preventing oxidative DNA damage induced by H2O2. In order to accomplish this, the Comet assay (single-cell gel electrophoresis) was used to measure DNA damage in peripheral blood cells harvested before and after supplementation with Brazil nut. Comet assay was also applied ex vivo to measure the potential of Se to prevent oxidative damage to DNA induced by H2O2 in blood of type 2 diabetes patients collected before and after six months of supplementation with Brazil nut. We found that supplementation with Brazil nuts significantly increased serum Se levels. Furthermore, we observed a significant increase in fasting blood glucose after six months of consuming Brazil nuts; however, no significant effect was observed on the levels of glycated hemoglobin. Finally, we noticed that the cells were more resistant to H2O2-induced DNA damage after six months of supplementation with Brazil nut. Thus, consumption of Brazil nuts could decrease oxidative DNA damage in T2D patients, probably through the antioxidative effects of Se.","Bertholletia, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2, Humans, Hydrogen Peroxide, Oxidative Stress, Selenium",no,yes,Unknown,yes,LAaC,32811197.0, Brazil nut prevents oxidative DNA damage in type 2 diabetes patients ,no,yes,yes,lac,,False
31422188,Proteomic characterization of medicinal plants used in the treatment of diabetes,"Several plants have been studied for their medicinal properties, especially concerning the management of chronic diseases, such as diabetes, aiming at a more accessible form of treatment. In this context, the aim of this study was to characterize plant proteins used in folk medicine as hypoglycemic agents for the treatment of diabetes, namely ""abajerú"" (Chrysobalanus icaco) and ""cow's paw"" (Bauhinia forficata and Bauhinia variegata). The species were differentiated by proteome characterization. Proteins were in-solution digested using trypsin by the filter-assisted sample preparation (FASP) method. Peptides were then analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for protein characterization. In total, 131 proteins were identified. The main biological functions of these proteins were cellular respiration, transport, metabolism and photosynthesis. Insulin-like proteins were not detected, but proteins involved in controlling glucose levels were. The results are of value in the proteomic characterization of phytotherapeutic plants, and may serve as baseline for the assessed species in Brazil, where a lack of knowledge in this regard is observed.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

We determined the allele frequencies and influence of these SNPs alone and in a weighted genetic risk score on FG, homeostasis model assessment of β-cell function (HOMA-B), and IFG by race/ethnicity, while adjusting for age and sex.All allele frequencies varied significantly by race/ethnicity. A weighted genetic risk score, based on 16 SNPs, was associated with a 0.022 mmol/l (95% CI 0.009-0.035), 0.036 mmol/l (0.019-0.052), and 0.033 mmol/l (0.020-0.046) increase in FG levels per risk allele among non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, and Mexican Americans, respectively. Adjusted odds ratios for IFG were 1.78 for non-Hispanic whites (95% CI 1.00-3.17), 2.40 for non-Hispanic blacks (1.07-5.37), and 2.39 for Mexican Americans (1.37-4.14) when we compared the highest with the lowest quintiles of genetic risk score (P=0.365 for testing heterogeneity of effect across race/ethnicity).We conclude that allele frequencies of 16 novel FG-associated SNPs vary significantly by race/ethnicity, but the influence of these SNPs on FG levels, HOMA-B, and IFG were generally consistent across all racial/ethnic groups.","Adult, Black People, Blood Glucose, Fasting, Female, Genotype, Glucose Intolerance, Hispanic or Latino, Humans, Male, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide, United States, White People",yes,no,lac,yes,LAaC,20805255.0," Racial/ethnic differences in association of fasting glucose-associated genomic loci with fasting glucose, HOMA-B, and impaired fasting glucose in the U.S. adult population ",yes,yes,yes,Unknown,,False

However, little is known about the etiology of this disease and changes that occur within host tubers that result in its symptoms. Previous studies found that increased levels of phenolics, amino acids, defense proteins, and carbohydrates in 'Ca. L. solanacearum'-infected tubers are associated with symptoms of zebra chip. This study was conducted to quantify variations in levels of these biochemical components in relation to the time of infestation, symptom severity, and 'Ca. L. solanacearum' titer. Levels of phenolics, peroxidases, polyphenol oxidases, and reducing sugars (glucose and, to some extent, fructose) changed during infection, with higher levels occurring in tubers infected at least 5 weeks before harvest than in those infected only a week before harvest and those of controls. Compared with the apical tuber ends, greater levels of phenolics, peroxidases, and sucrose occurred at the basal (stolon attachment) end of infected tubers. With the exception of phenolics, concentrations of the evaluated compounds were not associated with 'Ca. L. solanacearum' titer. However, there were significant associations between biochemical responses and symptom severity. The lack of a linear correlation between most plant biochemical responses and 'Ca. L. solanacearum' titer suggests that shifts in metabolic profiles are independent of variations in 'Ca.

19721699,Trypanosoma cruzi IIc: phylogenetic and phylogeographic insights from sequence and microsatellite analysis and potential impact on emergent Chagas disease,"Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas disease, is highly genetically diverse. Numerous lines of evidence point to the existence of six stable genetic lineages or DTUs: TcI, TcIIa, TcIIb, TcIIc, TcIId, and TcIIe. Molecular dating suggests that T. cruzi is likely to have been an endemic infection of neotropical mammalian fauna for many millions of years. Here we have applied a panel of 49 polymorphic microsatellite markers developed from the online T. cruzi genome to document genetic diversity among 53 isolates belonging to TcIIc, a lineage so far recorded almost exclusively in silvatic transmission cycles but increasingly a potential source of human infection. These data are complemented by parallel analysis of sequence variation in a fragment of the glucose-6-phosphate isomerase gene. New isolates confirm that TcIIc is associated with terrestrial transmission cycles and armadillo reservoir hosts, and demonstrate that TcIIc is far more widespread than previously thought, with a distribution at least from Western Venezuela to the Argentine Chaco. We show that TcIIc is truly a discrete T. cruzi lineage, that it could have an ancient origin and that diversity occurs within the terrestrial niche independently of the host species. We also show that spatial structure among TcIIc isolates from its principal host, the armadillo Dasypus novemcinctus, is greater than that among TcI from Didelphis spp. opossums and link this observation to differences in ecology of their respective niches. Homozygosity in TcIIc populations and some linkage indices indicate the possibility of recombination but cannot yet be effectively discriminated from a high genome-wide frequency of gene conversion. Finally, we suggest that the derived TcIIc population genetic data have a vital role in determining the origin of the epidemiologically important hybrid lineages TcIId and TcIIe.",,no,no,Unknown,yes,LAaC,19721699.0, Trypanosoma cruzi IIc: phylogenetic and phylogeographic insights from sequence and microsatellite analysis and potential impact on emergent Chagas disease ,no,no,yes,lac,,False
35966843,Whole genome sequencing of the multidrug-resistant Chryseobacterium indologenes isolated from a patient in Brazil,"Chryseobacterium indologenes is a non-glucose-fermenting Gram-negative bacillus. This emerging multidrug resistant opportunistic nosocomial pathogen can cause severe infections in neonates and immunocompromised patients. This study aimed to present the first detailed draft genome sequence of a multidrug-resistant C. indologenes strain isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid of an infant hospitalized at the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit of Brazilian Tertiary Hospital. We first analyzed the susceptibility of C. indologenes strain to different antibiotics using the VITEK 2 system. The strain demonstrated an outstanding resistance to all the antibiotic classes tested, including Î²-lactams, aminoglycosides, glycylcycline, and polymyxin. Next, C. indologenes was whole-genome-sequenced, annotated using Prokka and Rapid Annotation using Subsystems Technology (RAST), and screened for orthologous groups (EggNOG), gene ontology (GO), resistance genes, virulence genes, and mobile genetic elements using different software tools. The draft genome contained one circular chromosome of 4,836,765 bp with 37.32% GC content. The genomic features of the chromosome present numerous genes related to cellular processes that are essential to bacteria. The MDR C. indologenes revealed the presence of genes that corresponded to the resistance phenotypes, including genes to Î²-lactamases (bla IND-13, bla CIA-3, bla TEM-116, bla OXA-209, bla VEB-15), quinolone (mcbG), tigecycline (tet(X6)), and genes encoding efflux pumps which confer resistance to aminoglycosides (RanA/RanB), and colistin (HlyD/TolC). Amino acid substitutions related to quinolone resistance were observed in GyrA (S83Y) and GyrB (L425I and K473R). A mutation that may play a role in the development of colistin resistance was detected in lpxA (G68D). Chryseobacterium indologenes isolate harbored 19 virulence factors, most of which were involved in infection pathways. We identified 13 Genomic Islands (GIs) and some elements associated with one integrative and conjugative element (ICEs). Other elements linked to mobile genetic elements (MGEs), such as insertion sequence (ISEIsp1), transposon (Tn5393), and integron (In31), were also present in the C. indologenes genome. Although plasmids were not detected, a ColRNAI replicon type and the most resistance genes detected in singletons were identified in unaligned scaffolds. We provided a wide range of information toward the understanding of the genomic diversity of C. indologenes, which can contribute to controlling the evolution and dissemination of this pathogen in healthcare settings.Copyright Â© 2022 Damas, Ferreira, Campanini, Soares, Campos, Laprega, Soares da Costa, Freire, Pitondo-Silva, Cerdeira, Cunha and Pranchevicius.",,no,no,Unknown,yes,LAaC,35966843.0, Whole genome sequencing of the multidrug-resistant Chryseobacterium indologenes isolated from a patient in Brazil ,no,no,yes,lac,,False

Its pathogenicity depends on the secretion of hydrolytic enzymes that degrade the host cuticle. To identify proteins involved in the infection process and in host specify, immunoproteomic analysis was performed using antiserum produced against crude extract of M. anisopliae cultured in the presence of Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus and Dysdercus peruvianus cuticles. Spots detected using antisera produced against M. anisopliae cultured in cuticles and spore surface proteins, but not with antiserum against M. anisopliae cultured in glucose, were identified so as to give insights about the infection process. An MS/MS allowed the identification of proteases, like elastase, trypsin, chymotrypsin, carboxypeptidase and subtilisin (Pr1A, Pr1I and PR1J), chitinases, DNase I and proline-rich protein. Chymotrypsin and Pr1I were inferred as host specific, being recognized in D. peruvianus infection only.

There was no relationship between lipid profile, uric acid, and fructose consumption. The fasting blood glucose (FBG), fasting insulin, HOMA-IR, and TyG index values in the moderate fructose consumption group were significantly lower than those for the high fructose consumption group (PÂ <Â 0.05). The TyG index was associated with fructose consumption and HOMA-IR (PÂ <Â 0.05). High fructose consumers exhibited FBG and HOMA-IR levels 1.18 (95% confidence interval [95% CI]Â =Â 1.01-1.37) and 1.42 (95% CIÂ =Â 1.09-1.84) times higher than those for the moderate fructose consumers (PÂ <Â 0.05).The results of this study confirmed that high fructose consumption negatively affects glycemic status in healthy adults. Additionally, this study revealed that there is a significant association between daily fructose consumption and TyG index.Copyright Â© 2022 European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

Nearly 70% of these cases have loss of methylation at the differentially methylated region on chromosome 6q24. To describe the findings in a Turkish male patient with NDM caused by a loss of methylation at chromosome 6q24 and three novel homozygous mutations in the ZFP57 gene, methylation-specific PCR was carried out at 6q24 and mutation analysis of ZFP57 gene was maintained by direct sequencing. Sequencing of ZFP57 gene revealed the hypomethylation of chromosome 6q24 and three novel mutations (chr6:29.641.413 A>T, 29.641.073 C>T, and 29.640.855 G>C), respectively. The latter mutation seems to display the patient's condition due to a highly conservative amino acid substitution in the protein. We suggest the ZFP57 gene as a causative factor for NDM and it should be considered in genetic testing. Further studies including functional analysis of the detected mutations will provide precise information regarding the effect of the mutations.","Amino Acid Sequence, Chromosomes, Human, Pair 6, DNA Methylation, DNA Mutational Analysis, DNA-Binding Proteins, Diabetes Mellitus, Homozygote, Humans, Infant, Newborn, Infant, Newborn, Diseases, Male, Mutation, Polymerase Chain Reaction, Repressor Proteins, Sequence Homology, Amino Acid, Transcription Factors, Turkey",yes,yes,mena,yes,MEaNA,23748067.0, Transient neonatal diabetes mellitus in a Turkish patient with three novel homozygous variants in the ZFP57 gene ,yes,yes,yes,cee,,False
24636181,Prevalence of dyslipidemia and associated risk factors in Turkish adults,"Dyslipidemia is a modifiable major risk factor for coronary heart disease. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of dyslipidemia among Turkish adults and its associations with other cardiovascular risk factors.This study included 4309 people ages 20 to 83Â years old from 7 provinces of Turkey. People from the city centers, districts, and villages were selected by a stratified sampling method. Weight, height, and waist and hip circumferences were measured. Blood samples were obtained to determine glucose, total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and triglycerides (TG); these parameters were measured with an autoanalyzer. Dyslipidemia was defined according to National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III diagnostic criteria.Of 4309 subjects, 43% had high TC, 41.5% had low HDL-C, 36.2% had high LDL-C, and 35.7% had high TG. Of these measures, at least 1 lipid abnormality was diagnosed in 78.7% of men and 80.4% of women. The prevalence of high TC, LDL-C, and TG increased with age, with the highest prevalence in the 46-to-65-year-old age group. The mean values (mg/dL) of TC, LDL-C, HDL-C, and TG were 194.2Â Â±Â 47.7, 117.7Â Â±Â 41.1, 50.3Â Â±Â 16.3, and 145.4Â Â±Â 96.3, respectively. Dyslipidemia was positively associated with age, body mass index, waist circumference, fasting blood glucose, and blood pressure, and negatively associated with altitude.The high prevalence of dyslipidemia in Turkey is an important public health problem.

34924789,Proteasome Modulator 9 Gene rs14259 Polymorphism in Patients with Diabetic Polyneuropathy,"Diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN) is a major chronic neurological complication of diabetes mellitus (DM) and typically presents as diabetic sensory polyneuropathy (DSPN). Whereas some patients with similar risk factors develop polyneuropathy, others don't, which suggests that genetics plays an important role in the progression of disease. The proteasome modulator 9 gene (PSMD9) is a transcriptional regulator of the insulin gene and its variants cause beta-cell dysfunction that devastates insulin transcription. The aim of this study was to determine the correlation between PSMD9 rs14259 polymorphism and the risk of DSPN in Turkish DM patients with DPN.The study included 31 DM patients with DSPN and 29 healthy controls. All participants underwent electrophysiological investigation. In addition, DNA was isolated from peripheral blood samples for the genotyping of PSMD9 rs14259 polymorphism.Mean age in the DSPN and control groups was 58.03Â±9.59 years and 57.62Â±12.32 years, respectively. There were significant differences between the DSPN and controls groups in the frequencies of the genotype for AA (n=9 and n=12, respectively), AG (n=10 and n=15, respectively), and GG (n=12 and n=2, respectively). According to the distribution of PSMD9 rs14259 polymorphism, 45.2% (n=28) of the patients and 67.2% (n=39) of the controls had the A allele, and 54.8% (n=34) of the patients and 32.8% (n=19) of the controls had the G allele, whereas the frequency of the G allele of rs14259 was significantly higher in the DSPN group (X2=1.059, P=0.015) than in the control group (OR: 2.49; 95% CI: 1.18-5.23).The present findings show that the GG genotype and G allele of PSMD9 rs14259 polymorphism may be associated with an increased risk of DSPN in Turkish DM patients.Copyright: Â© 2021 Turkish Neuropsychiatric Society.",,yes,yes,mena,yes,MEaNA,34924789.0, Proteasome Modulator 9 Gene rs14259 Polymorphism in Patients with Diabetic Polyneuropathy ,yes,yes,yes,cee,,False
18719658,Gender differences in the relationship of ENPP1/PC-1 variants to obesity in a Turkish population,"The ectoenzyme ENPP1 (also termed membrane glycoprotein PC-1 or ENPP1/PC-1) is an inhibitor of insulin-induced activation of the insulin receptor. There is evidence from previous studies that coding variants of ENPP1/PC-1 (K121Q) are associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity. Studies in the general Turkish population have demonstrated: unique plasma lipid characteristics, a high prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors, and an increased prevalence of obesity and T2D. We investigated, therefore, the association of ENPP1/PC-1 variants with obesity and T2D in Turkish individuals. The TaqMan allelic discrimination assay was used for genotyping the relationship of ENPP1/PC-1 variants to obesity and T2D in a genetic association study of 1,553 genotyped, randomly selected subjects from the Turkish Heart Study. The K121Q (rs1044498) variant and other previously reported variants (rs997509, rs1799774, rs1044548, rs11964389, rs7754561) were analyzed. In this cohort, the minor allele frequency (MAF) of the K121Q variant was associated with obesity in male, but not in female subjects (male, odds ratio 1.64, 95% confidence interval 1.004-2.698, P = 0.048; female, odds ratio 1.003, 95% confidence interval 0.684-1.471, P = ns). In addition, the previously reported ENPP1/PC-1 ""risk haplotype"" (Q (rs1044498), delT (rs1799774), and G (rs7754561) alleles) was found to be associated with obesity in male, but not in female, subjects (P = 0.035). In contrast, there was no association of either the K121Q variant or the ENPP1/PC-1 haplotype with T2D. We find evidence that variants of ENPP1/PC-1 are associated with obesity in the male Turkish population; thus, these variants may contribute to the development of the obesity in these individuals.","Adult, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2, Female, Gene Frequency, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, Genetic Variation, Haplotypes, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Obesity, Phosphoric Diester Hydrolases, Pyrophosphatases, Sex Characteristics, Turkey",yes,yes,mena,yes,MEaNA,18719658.0, Gender differences in the relationship of ENPP1/PC-1 variants to obesity in a Turkish population ,yes,yes,yes,cee,,False

Experiments using 3T3-L1 adipocyte cultured cells and human adipose stem cells (hASCc) have shown that HAd36 stimulates the expression of genes implicated in cell differentiation and increased lipid accumulation. The presence of HAd36 in adipose tissue of overweight and obese women has also been confirmed. This study aims to analyze the presence of HAd36 DNA in the adipose tissue of women undergoing surgery for weight reduction and its relationship with obesity through changes in adipocyte morphology as well as the expression of C/EBPÎ² and HIF-1Î±.Fifty-two subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsies were collected. The anthropometric parameters measured were weight, height, skin folds, body circumferences, and body fat percentage. Biochemical measures were performed for glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, cholesterol HDL-c, and LDL-c. The presence of HAd36 DNA was performed by conventional PCR. Adipocyte morphology was analyzed in H&E-stained sections using ImageJ/Fiji software. The expression of genes C/EBPÎ², HIF-1Î± and Î²-actin was determined using TaqMan probes.HAd36 DNA was detected in 31% of adipose tissue samples. The presence of viral DNA was not significantly associated with anthropometric, clinical, or metabolic measurements, or with changes in adipose tissue morphology. The levels of mRNA expression for C/EBPÎ² and HIF-1Î± did not show significant differences between positive and negative samples for HAd36 (p>0.05).The presence of HAd36 DNA in adipose tissue was identified, but it was not related to morphological changes of adipocytes, or the expression of C/EBPÎ² and HIF-1Î±.

GDM women are with inflammatory and metabolisms abnormalities. However, few studies have focused on the association of IL-65-72C/G and TNF-Î± -857C/T single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), inflammatory biomarkers, and metabolic indexes in women with GDM, especially in the Inner Mongolia population. The aim of this study was to investigate the associations of IL-65-72C/G and TNF-Î± -857C/T SNPs, and inflammation and metabolic biomarkers in women with GDM pregnancies. MATERIAL AND METHODS Blood samples and placentas from 140 women with GDM and 140 women with healthy pregnancies were collected. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) and MassARRAY-IPLEX were performed to analyze IL-65-72C/G and TNF-Î± -857C/T SNPs. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed to analyze inflammatory biomarkers and adipokines. RESULTS Distribution frequency of TNF-Î± -857CT (OR=3.316, 95% CI=1.092-8.304, p=0.025) in women with GDM pregnancies were obviously higher than that in women with healthy pregnancies. Women with GDM were of older maternal age, had higher BMI, were more nulliparous, and had T2DM and GDM history, compared to women with healthy pregnancies (p<0.05). Inflammatory biomarkers in serum (hs-CRP, IL-6, IL-8, IL-6/IL-10 ratio) and placental (NF-ÎºB, IL-6, IL-8, IL-6/IL-10 ratio, IL-1b, TNF-Î±) were significantly different (p<0.05) between women with GDM and women with healthy pregnancies.

The serum lncRNA XIST and miR-30d-5p expression levels of each group were compared. The correlation between serum lncRNA XIST and miR-30d-5p in DPN patients was analyzed. The influencing factors of DPN occurrence were analyzed. Also, the diagnostic value of serum lncRNA XIST and miR-30d-5p for DPN was analyzed.There were significant differences in the lncRNA XIST and miR-30d-5p expression levels among the pure T2DM group, DPN group, and control group. LncRNA XIST expression level was negatively correlated with miR-30d-5p in DPN patients (P<0.05). Triglycerides, hemoglobin A1c, miR-30d-5p were risk factors for the occurrence of DPN, and lncRNA XIST was a protective factor (P<0.05). The areas under the curve (AUC) of serum lncRNA XIST and miR-30d-5p for the diagnosis of DPN were 0.851 and 0.845, respectively, and the AUC of lncRNA XIST and miR-30d-5p combined was 0.932, with a sensitivity of 92.1%, and a specificity of 85.5%.Both lncRNA XIST and miR-30d-5p may be involved in the development of type 2 DPN.

Results: Serum-insulin levels, the inhibitory effects on alpha-glucosidase, serum-catalase (CAT) and lipid peroxidation (LPO) levels were also monitored. AP was shown to be rich in polyphenolics like trans-lutein (14.1%), trans-zeaxanthin (10.5%), trans-ÃŸ-cryptoxanthin (11.6%), 13, cis-ÃŸ-carotene (6.5%), trans 9, cis-ÃŸ-carotene (18.4%), and ÃŸ-carotene (21.5%). Prunus armeniaca kernel extract before detoxification (KAP) was found to be rich in amygdaline (16.1%), which caused a high mortality rate (50.1%), while after detoxification (amygdaline, 1.4%) a lower mortality rate (9.1%) was found. AP showed significant (p â‰¤ 0.05, n = 7/group) antidiabetic-activity more prominent than DKAP acutely, subchronically and on longer-terms. IR-AEs displayed more efficient acute and subchronic blood glucose level (BGL) reduction than a conventional extraction method, which might be attributed to IR-AE superiority in extraction of active ingredients. AP showed more-significant and dose-dependent increase in serum-insulin, CAT-levels and body-weights more prominent than those of DKAP. Alpha-glucosidase and LPO levels were inhibited with AP-groups more-significantly._x000D_

Conclusion: In comparison to conventional-methods, IR-AE appeared to be an efficient and time-conserving novel extraction method. The antidiabetic-potentials of pomace and detoxified-kernels of P. armeniaca were probably mediated via the attenuation of glucose-provoked oxidative-stress, the inhibition of alpha-glucosidase and the marked insulin-secretagogue effect.

34699679,Treatment and control of modifiable cardiovascular risk factors among patients with diabetes mellitus and hypertension in Inner Mongolia: A cross-sectional study,"The authors assessed treatment and control of blood glucose, blood pressure (BP), and blood lipids among patients from Inner Mongolia with diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension (HTN) and identified the modifiable factors associated with treatment and achievement of blood glucose, BP, and blood lipid targets. The authors used a multistage stratified cluster sampling method according to geographical location and level of economic development in Inner Mongolia. Among patients with DM and HTN, the crude rates of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) treatment and control was 30.76% and 4.73%, respectively. Crude rates of BP treatment and control were 50.81% and 8.70%, respectively. The authors found that treatment rates of HTN and DM and control rates of BP and FPG showed a gradually increasing trend with increased age. Among patients with DM and HTN, the likelihood of treatment for HTN and DM was significantly increased among participants who were older, non-Mongolian, male, obese, smokers, and those with previous cardiovascular disease. The authors found that control of BP, FPG, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was far from optimal among study participants. Medical and health departments in Inner Mongolia should take appropriate measures to reduce the burden of DM and HTN in the population, such as by promoting and improving the quality of HTN and DM treatment to achieve control goals and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.Â© 2021 The Authors.

26290879,Association Analysis of Genetic Variants with Type 2 Diabetes in a Mongolian Population in China,"The large scale genome wide association studies (GWAS) have identified approximately 80 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) conferring susceptibility to type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, most of these loci have not been replicated in diverse populations and much genetic heterogeneity has been observed across ethnic groups. We tested 28 SNPs previously found to be associated with T2D by GWAS in a Mongolian sample of Northern China (497 diagnosed with T2D and 469 controls) for association with T2D and diabetes related quantitative traits. We replicated T2D association of 11 SNPs, namely, rs7578326 (IRS1), rs1531343 (HMGA2), rs8042680 (PRC1), rs7578597 (THADA), rs1333051 (CDKN2), rs6723108 (TMEM163), rs163182 and rs2237897 (KCNQ1), rs1387153 (MTNR1B), rs243021 (BCL11A), and rs10229583 (PAX4) in our sample. Further, we showed that risk allele of the strongest T2D associated SNP in our sample, rs757832 (IRS1), is associated with increased level of TG. We observed substantial difference of T2D risk allele frequency between the Mongolian sample and the 1000G Caucasian sample for a few SNPs, including rs6723108 (TMEM163) whose risk allele reaches near fixation in the Mongolian sample. Further study of genetic architecture of these variants in susceptibility of T2D is needed to understand the role of these variants in heterogeneous populations.","Adult, Aged, Alleles, Asian People, Body Mass Index, China, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2, Female, Gene Frequency, Genetic Markers, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, Genetic Variation, Genome-Wide Association Study, Genotype, Humans, Logistic Models, Male, Middle Aged, Mongolia, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide, Quality Control, Triglycerides",yes,yes,ca,yes,CA,26290879.0, Association Analysis of Genetic Variants with Type 2 Diabetes in a Mongolian Population in China ,yes,yes,yes,ea,,False

27660219,"Alcohol Drinking, Dyslipidemia, and Diabetes: A Population-based Prospective Cohort Study among Inner Mongolians in China","No previous studies have evaluated the association between dyslipidemia, alcohol drinking, and diabetes in an Inner Mongolian population. We aimed to evaluate the co-effects of drinking and dyslipidemia on diabetes incidence in this population.The present study was based on 1880 participants from a population-based prospective cohort study among Inner Mongolians living in China. Participants were classified into four subgroups according to their drinking status and dyslipidemia. Multivariate logistic regression analysis and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to evaluate the association between alcohol drinking, dyslipidemia, and diabetes.During the follow-up period, 203 participants were found to have developed diabetes. The multivariable-adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence interval) for the incidence of non-dyslipidemia/drinkers, dyslipidemia/non-drinkers, and dyslipidemia/drinkers in diabetic patients were 1.40 (0.82-2.37), 1.73 (1.17-2.55), and 2.31 (1.38-3.87), respectively, when compared with non-dyslipidemia/non-drinkers. The area under the ROC curve for a model containing dyslipidemia and drinking status along with conventional factors (AUC=0.746) was significantly (P=0.003) larger than the one containing only conventional factors (AUC=0.711).The present study showed that dyslipidemia was an independent risk factor for diabetes, and that drinkers with dyslipidemia had the highest risk of diabetes in the Mongolian population. These findings suggest that dyslipidemia and drinking status may be valuable in predicting diabetes incidence.Copyright Â© 2016 The Editorial Board of Biomedical and Environmental Sciences.

35052672,"Protection against Neurological Symptoms by Consuming Corn Silk Water Extract in Artery-Occluded Gerbils with Reducing Oxidative Stress, Inflammation, and Post-Stroke Hyperglycemia through the Gut-Brain Axis","Corn silk (Stigma maydis), rich in flavonoids, is traditionally used to treat edema, depression, and hyperglycemia and may alleviate ischemic stroke symptoms in Chinese medicine. This study examined whether corn silk water extract (CSW) could alleviate ischemic stroke symptoms and post-stroke hyperglycemia in Mongolian gerbils with transient cerebral ischemia and reperfusion (I/R). After being given 0.05% (I/R-LCSW) and 0.2% (I/R-HCSW), 0.02% aspirin (I/R-aspirin), and cellulose (I/R-control) in their 40 energy% fat diets for three weeks, the gerbils underwent an artery occlusion for eight minutes and reperfusion. They took the assigned diet for an additional three weeks. Sham-operated gerbils without artery occlusion had the same diet as Sham-control. CSW intake reduced neuronal cell death in gerbils with I/R and dose-dependently improved the neurological symptoms, including drooped eyes, crouched posture, flexor reflex, and walking patterns. CSW intake also alleviated the short-term memory and spontaneous alteration and grip strength compared to the I/R-control group. The protection against ischemic stroke symptoms was associated with the reduced tumor necrosis factor-Î±, interleukin-1Î², superoxide, and lipid peroxide levels, promoting superoxide dismutase activity in the hippocampus in the CSW groups, compared to the I/R-control. The blood flow measured by Doppler was improved with CSW compared to the I/R-control. Furthermore, CSW intake prevented the post-stroke hyperglycemia related to decreasing pancreatic Î²-cell mass as much as the Sham-control, and it was related to protection against Î²-cell apoptosis, restoring the Î²-cell mass similar to the Sham-control. CSW intake elevated the relative abundance of Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Allobaculum, and Akkermansia compared to the I/R-control. Picrust2 analysis showed that CSW increased the propionate and butyrate metabolism and the starch and glucose metabolism but reduced lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis compared to the I/R-control.

17416291,Prevalence of dyslipidemia and associated factors among the hypertensive rural chinese population,"Dyslipidemia plays a crucial rule in the development of cardiovascular disease, which has become the leading cause of death in most developed countries as well as in developing countries. This study was designed to investigate the epidemiological features of dyslipidemia in rural adults with hypertension in China.A cross-sectional survey was conducted during 2004-2006 through a cluster multistage sampling to a resident group of 6,412 individuals (2,805 men, 3,607 women) with hypertension, aged >/=35 years, in the countryside of Liaoning, China. Serum lipids levels were proposed by National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III.Of the study population 34.4% had borderline high total cholesterol (TC), 16.9% had high TC, and 8.8% had low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). The population with borderline high, high, and very high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) was 15.7, 3.5, and 0.9%, respectively. In addition, 15.9% had borderline high triglycerides (TG), 17.8% had high TG and 2.0% had very high TG. After adjusting for independent variables, TC and TG had the same risk with fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and body mass index. Risk factors of TC and LDL-C were women, age and FPG. Mongolia nationality as a protective factor positively correlated with TC, LDL-C, and TG. Women, age, drinking, and classification of blood pressure were protective factors but Mongolia nationality was a risk factor for HDL-C.This study demonstrated that the prevalence of dyslipidemia was relatively high among rural hypertensive patients in China and there were many modifiable risk factors for dyslipidemia such as hypertension, weight, and impaired glucose metabolism. To prevent dyslipidemia and to reduce the increasing burden of cardiovascular disease in rural areas with the undeveloped economy of China, the first aim for us is to reduce these risk factors.","Adult, Asian People, China, Cholesterol, Dyslipidemias, Female, Humans, Hypertension, Male, Prevalence, Rural Population, Triglycerides",no,no,ca,yes,CA,17416291.0, Prevalence of dyslipidemia and associated factors among the hypertensive rural Chinese population ,no,no,yes,ea,,False

Results: There were significant differences in the UA levels between different genders and regions. The total prevalence of HUA is 13.7%. Men had a higher prevalence of HUA than women (21% vs. 7.9%; P < 0.0001). As age increased, HUA prevalence decreased in men but rose in women. The suburbs of big cities had the highest HUA prevalence (18.7%), and in high-prevalence areas the proportion of women with HUA also increased. A stepwise logistic regression model was used to filter out twelve HUA risk factors, including age, gender, residence, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, impaired fasting glucose, hypertension, obesity, abdominal obesity, CKD, drinking and sleeping. After adjusting for these factors, the odds ratio of HUA was 1.92 times higher in men than in women. Compared with agricultural and pastoral areas, the odds ratio of having HUA was 2.14 for participants in the suburbs of big cities and 1.57 in the center of big cities._x000D_

23210729,Association of hypertension with coexistence of abnormal metabolism and inflammation and endothelial dysfunction,"To explore association of hypertension with coexistence of inflammation and endothelial dysfunction and abnormal metabolism, a community-based study was conducted among Mongolian people in China. Demographic characteristics and lifestyle risk factors were investigated, blood pressure, body weight and waist circumference were measured, fasting blood samples were obtained to measure blood lipids, fasting plasma glucose and the biomarkers of inflammation and endothelial dysfunction, C-reactive protein (CRP), soluble intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), soluble E-selectin (sE-selectin) and angiotensin II. Rates of abnormal metabolism, elevated CRP, elevated sICAM-1, elevated sE-selectin and elevated angiotensin II as well as coexistence of abnormal metabolism with the elevated biomarkers were all higher in hypertensives than these in normotensives (all p < 0.01). Compared with subjects with normal metabolism and without any elevated biomarker, multivariate adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of hypertension associated with abnormal metabolism, elevated CRP, elevated sICAM-1, elevated sE-selectin, elevated angiotensin II, coexistences of abnormal metabolism with elevated CRP, elevated sICAM-1,elevated sE-selectin and elevated angiotensin II were 2.209 (1.594-3.062), 2.820 (1.992-3.992), 2.370 (1.665-3.374), 1.893 (1.331-2.691), 2.545 (1.793-3.612), 2.990 (2.102-4.252), 2.551 (1.775-3.667), 2.223 (1.544-3.220), 3.135 (2.185-4.519), respectively. In conclusion, this study indicated that inflammation and endothelial dysfunction was associated with hypertension and abnormal metabolism, and individuals with co-existence of abnormal metabolism with inflammation and endothelial dysfunction had higher risk of prevalent hypertension among Mongolian population. This study suggests that further study on treatment for hypertension patients with coexistence of abnormal metabolism with inflammation and endothelial dysfunction should be conducted in the near future.","Adult, C-Reactive Protein, Cross-Sectional Studies, E-Selectin, Endothelium, Vascular, Female, Humans, Hypertension, Inflammation, Male, Middle Aged, Risk Factors, Surveys and Questionnaires, Vascular Diseases",no,no,ca,yes,CA,23210729.0, Association of hypertension with coexistence of abnormal metabolism and inflammation and endothelial dysfunction ,no,no,yes,ea,,False
22244945,Epidemiologic characteristics of intraocular pressure in the Korean and Mongolian populations: the Healthy Twin and the GENDISCAN study,"The purpose of this study was to demonstrate a negative association between intraocular pressure (IOP) and age in 2 Asian populations. In addition, we evaluated genetic and nongenetic factors associated with IOP.Family-based cohort study.Study subjects >10 years of age from one Korean (The Healthy Twin; n = 1431) and 2 Mongolian populations (The GENDISCAN; n = 859 and 806) with IOP values.The IOP values were measured with a noncontact tonometer. Each participant received a standard health examination and received questionnaires, which include candidate risk factors on IOP. Mixed models were used to identify risk factors for IOP. Variance-component methods were applied to estimate the heritability of IOP.The negative trend of IOP with aging and evaluation of impact of genetic and nongenetic components on IOP.The mean ages were 43.6, 34.1, and 36.3 years for the Korean, Orhontuul, and Dashbalbar populations, respectively. The mean IOPs were 14.4 mmHg (95% confidence interval [CI], 14.3-14.6) in the Koreans and 14.1 mmHg (95% CI, 13.9-14.3) and 12.6 mmHg (95% CI, 12.4-12.9) in the Orhontuul and Dashbalbar populations, respectively. In the 3 populations, the IOP decreased as age increased. We replicated an association of systolic blood pressure (SBP) with IOP. In addition, components of the metabolic syndrome (MS), such as plasma glucose, lipid level, and body mass index, showed positive associations with IOP, after adjusting for age and SBP. The IOP also had strong genetic contributions in all populations (heritability, 0.47-0.51).Negative associations between age and IOP were observed in all 3 populations, which cannot be explained by the increasing prevalence of myopia in the younger generation. The different age trend in IOP may in part be responsible for differences in the prevalence of glaucoma subtypes. Our findings suggest that associations between IOP and MS components were independent of established risk factors such as SBP or age. In addition, the importance of inherited risks requires further genetic dissection of IOP determinants for biological understandings of underlying pathophysiology.Copyright Ã‚Â© 2012 American Academy of Ophthalmology.

The EtOAc fraction of SAD showed a significant effect on PPARgamma activation. A simple and rapid method has been established for separation and characterization of the main compounds in the PPARgamma-activating fraction of SAD by ultra-fast HPLC coupled with quadropole time-of-flight mass pectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF/MS). A total of 10 compounds were identified in the activating fraction of SAD, including amygdalin (1), liquiritin (2), 6'-acetyliquiritin (3), liquiritigenin (4), isoliquiritigenin (5), formononetin (6), licoisoflavanone (7), glycycoumarin (8), glycyrol (9) and uercetin (10). The results also characterized formononetin as a predominant component in this fraction. The dose-effect relationship comparison study of formononetin and the EtOAc fraction of SAD by adding formononetin was performed, the results suggested that formononetin was the major component of the EtOAc fraction of SAD responsible for activating PPARgamma, and the method will possibly be applied to study the complex biological active constituents of other TCMs.","Animals, CHO Cells, Cricetinae, Cricetulus, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Drugs, Chinese Herbal, Humans, PPAR gamma",no,no,Unknown,yes,CA,19924040.0," Separation, characterization and dose-effect relationship of the PPARgamma-activating bio-active constituents in the Chinese herb formulation 'San-Ao decoction' ",no,no,yes,ea,,False

An observational study of Japanese, Koreans and Mongolians with extended histories of remarkably different frequencies of fish intake was conducted to examine whether differences in plasma n-3 PUFA affects CVD risk factors. We conducted a cross-sectional study in workplace settings and determined body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglyceride (TG), glucose, insulin, homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and fatty acid composition in plasma. A total of 411 Japanese, 418 Korean and 252 Mongolian workers aged 30-60 yr participated in this study. The Japanese ate fish more frequently and had remarkably higher values of eicosapentaenoic acid, docosahexaenoic acid and n-3 PUFA, and lower values of BMI and HOMA-IR, followed by the Koreans, and then the Mongolians. In age groups, the Japanese and Koreans showed a similar tendency of increase in n-3 PUFA with increasing age. General linear measurement multivariate analysis after adjustment for gender, age, smoking, drinking, exercise habits and BMI showed n-3 PUFA was associated with HDL-C and TG in the Japanese, while it was associated with systolic blood pressure in the Koreans, and TG in the Mongolians.

30335765,Phosphoglucomutase 1 inhibits hepatocellular carcinoma progression by regulating glucose trafficking,"Glycogen metabolism commonly altered in cancer is just beginning to be understood. Phosphoglucomutase 1 (PGM1), the first enzyme in glycogenesis that catalyzes the reversible conversion between glucose 1-phosphate (G-1-P) and glucose 6-phosphate (G-6-P), participates in both the breakdown and synthesis of glycogen. Here, we show that PGM1 is down-regulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which is associated with the malignancy and poor prognosis of HCC. Decreased PGM1 expression obstructed glycogenesis pathway, which leads to the increased flow of glucose into glycolysis, thereby promoting tumor cell proliferation and HCC development. The loss of forkhead box protein J2 (FOXJ2), at least partly due to low genomic copy number in HCC, releases cellular nucleic acid-binding protein (CNBP), a nucleic acid chaperon, to bind to and promote G-quadruplex formation in PGM1 promoter and therefore decreases PGM1 expression. In addition, integrated analyses of PGM1 and FOXJ2 expression provide a better prediction for the malignance and prognosis of HCC. This study establishes a tumor-suppressive role of PGM1 by regulating glucose trafficking and uncovers a novel regulatory mechanism of PGM1 expression.","Animals, Carcinoma, Hepatocellular, Cell Line, Tumor, Cell Proliferation, Disease Progression, Down-Regulation, Female, Forkhead Transcription Factors, Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic, Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic, Glucose, Glycolysis, Hep G2 Cells, Humans, Liver Neoplasms, Male, Mice, Mice, Nude, Middle Aged, Phosphoglucomutase, Prognosis, Promoter Regions, Genetic, RNA-Binding Proteins",yes,no,Unknown,yes,SSA,30335765.0, Phosphoglucomutase 1 inhibits hepatocellular carcinoma progression by regulating glucose trafficking ,no,no,yes,ea,,False
31447391,Î±-Ketoglutarate-Activated NF-ÎºB Signaling Promotes Compensatory Glucose Uptake and Brain Tumor Development,"The rapid proliferation of cancer cells and dysregulated vasculature within the tumor leads to limited nutrient accessibility. Cancer cells often rewire their metabolic pathways for adaption to nutrient stress, and the underlying mechanism remains largely unknown. Glutamate dehydrogenase 1 (GDH1) is a key enzyme in glutaminolysis that converts glutamate to Î±-ketoglutarate (Î±-KG). Here, we show that, under low glucose, GDH1 is phosphorylated at serine (S) 384 and interacts with RelA and IKKÎ². GDH1-produced Î±-KG directly binds to and activates IKKÎ² and nuclear factor ÎºB (NF-ÎºB) signaling, which promotes glucose uptake and tumor cell survival by upregulating GLUT1, thereby accelerating gliomagenesis. In addition, GDH1 S384 phosphorylation correlates with the malignancy and prognosis of human glioblastoma. Our finding reveals a unique role of Î±-KG to directly regulate signal pathway, uncovers a distinct mechanism of metabolite-mediated NF-ÎºB activation, and also establishes the critical role of Î±-KG-activated NF-ÎºB in brain tumor development.","Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Animals, Brain Neoplasms, Cell Line, Tumor, Cell Proliferation, Cell Survival, Child, Energy Metabolism, Female, Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic, Glioblastoma, Glucose, Glucose Transporter Type 1, Glutamate Dehydrogenase, HEK293 Cells, Humans, I-kappa B Kinase, Ketoglutaric Acids, Male, Mice, Inbred BALB C, Mice, Nude, Middle Aged, NF-kappa B, Neoplasm Grading, Phosphorylation, Signal Transduction, Transcription Factor RelA, Young Adult",yes,no,ea,yes,SSA,31447391.0, alpha-Ketoglutarate-Activated NF-κB Signaling Promotes Compensatory Glucose Uptake and Brain Tumor Development ,no,no,yes,not specified,,False

If it can inhibit the activity of glycolysis-related enzymes and control the energy metabolism of tumor, it can be targeted for the treatment of malignant tumor. The target proteins phosphoglycerate kinase 2 (PGK2), glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPD2), and glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI) were screened by combining transcriptome, proteomics, and reverse docking. We detected the binding constant of the active compound using microscale thermophoresis (MST). It was found that esculetin bound well with three potential target proteins. Esculetin significantly inhibited the rate of glycolysis, manifested by differences of cellular lactate production and glucose consumption in HepG2 cells with or without esculetin. It was found that GPD2 bound strongly to GPI, revealing the direct interaction between the two glycolysis-related proteins. Animal tests have further demonstrated that esculetin may have anticancer effects by affecting the activity of PGK2, GPD2, and GPI. The results of this study demonstrated that esculetin can affect the glucose metabolism by binding to glycolytic proteins, thus playing an anti-tumor role, and these proteins which have direct interactions are potential novel targets for tumor treatment by esculetin.Copyright Â© 2020 Wu, Liu, Ai, Hong, You, Wu and Yang.",,yes,no,Unknown,yes,SSA,32292350.0," Esculetin Inhibits Cancer Cell Glycolysis by Binding Tumor PGK2, GPD2, and GPI ",yes,no,yes,not specified,,False
35963847,KCNK3 inhibits proliferation and glucose metabolism of lung adenocarcinoma via activation of AMPK-TXNIP pathway,"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a primary histological subtype of lung cancer with increased morbidity and mortality. K+ channels have been revealed to be involved in carcinogenesis in various malignant tumors. However, TWIK-related acid-sensitive potassium channel 1 (TASK-1, also called KCNK3), a genetic member of K2P channels, remains an enigma in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Herein, we investigated the pathological process of KCNK3 in proliferation and glucose metabolism of LUAD. The expressions of KCNK3 in LUAD tissues and corresponding adjacent tissues were identified by RNA sequencing, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, western blot, and immunohistochemistry. Gain and loss-of-function assays were performed to estimate the role of KCNK3 in proliferation and glucose metabolism of LUAD. Additionally, energy metabolites of LUAD cells were identified by targeted metabolomics analysis. The expressions of metabolic molecules and active biomarkers associated with AMPK-TXNIP signaling pathway were detected via western blot and immunofluorescence. KCNK3 was significantly downregulated in LUAD tissues and correlated with patients' poor prognosis. Overexpression of KCNK3 largely regulated the process of oncogenesis and glycometabolism in LUAD in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistic studies found that KCNK3-mediated differential metabolites were mainly enriched in AMPK signaling pathway. Furthermore, rescue experiments demonstrated that KCNK3 suppressed proliferation and glucose metabolism via activation of the AMPK-TXNIP pathway in LUAD cells. In summary, our research highlighted an emerging role of KCNK3 in the proliferative activity and glycometabolism of LUAD, suggesting that KCNK3 may be an optimal predictor for prognosis and a potential therapeutic target of LUAD.Â© 2022.

35780586,The splicing factor 9G8 regulates the expression of NADPH-producing enzyme genes in Drosophila,"Excess nutrients are stored as triglycerides, mostly as lipid droplets found in adipose tissue. Previous studies have characterized a group of splicing factors called serine/arginine rich (SR) proteins that function to identify intron/exon borders in regulating metabolic homeostasis in the Drosophila fat body. Decreasing the function of one SR protein, 9G8, causes an increase in triglyceride storage; however, the full complement of genes regulated by 9G8 to control metabolism is unknown. To address this question, we performed RNA sequencing on Drosophila fat bodies with 9G8 levels reduced by RNAi. Differential expression and differential exon usage analyses revealed several genes involved in the immune response, xenobiotic biology, protein translation, sleep, and lipid and carbohydrate metabolism whose expression or splicing is altered in 9G8-RNAi fat bodies. One gene that was both downregulated and had altered splicing in 9G8-RNAi fat bodies was Zwischenferment (Zw), the Drosophila homolog of human glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD). G6PD regulates flux of glucose 6-phosphate (G6P) into the pentose phosphate pathway, which generates NADPH, a coenzyme for lipid synthesis. Interestingly, the other NADPH-producing enzyme genes in Drosophila (phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, isocitrate dehydrogenase and malic enzyme) were also decreased in 9G8-RNAi flies. Together, these findings suggest that 9G8 regulates several classes of genes and may regulate NADPH-producing enzyme genes to maintain metabolic homeostasis.","Animals, Drosophila, Glucose, Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase, Humans, Lipids, NADP, Phosphates, RNA Splicing Factors, Serine-Arginine Splicing Factors",yes,no,Unknown,yes,SSA,35780586.0, The splicing factor 9G8 regulates the expression of NADPH-producing enzyme genes in Drosophila ,no,no,yes,none,,False
30366412,Stable Isotope Labeling Highlights Enhanced Fatty Acid and Lipid Metabolism in Human Acute Myeloid Leukemia,"Background: In Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), a complete response to chemotherapy is usually obtained after conventional chemotherapy but overall patient survival is poor due to highly frequent relapses. As opposed to chronic myeloid leukemia, B lymphoma or multiple myeloma, AML is one of the rare malignant hemopathies the therapy of which has not significantly improved during the past 30 years despite intense research efforts. One promising approach is to determine metabolic dependencies in AML cells. Moreover, two key metabolic enzymes, isocitrate dehydrogenases (IDH1/2), are mutated in more than 15% of AML patient, reinforcing the interest in studying metabolic reprogramming, in particular in this subgroup of patients. Methods: Using a multi-omics approach combining proteomics, lipidomics, and isotopic profiling of [U-13C] glucose and [U-13C] glutamine cultures with more classical biochemical analyses, we studied the impact of the IDH1 R132H mutation in AML cells on lipid biosynthesis. Results: Global proteomic and lipidomic approaches showed a dysregulation of lipid metabolism, especially an increase of phosphatidylinositol, sphingolipids (especially few species of ceramide, sphingosine, and sphinganine), free cholesterol and monounsaturated fatty acids in IDH1 mutant cells. Isotopic profiling of fatty acids revealed that higher lipid anabolism in IDH1 mutant cells corroborated with an increase in lipogenesis fluxes. Conclusions: This integrative approach was efficient to gain insight into metabolism and dynamics of lipid species in leukemic cells. Therefore, we have determined that lipid anabolism is strongly reprogrammed in IDH1 mutant AML cells with a crucial dysregulation of fatty acid metabolism and fluxes, both being mediated by 2-HG (2-Hydroxyglutarate) production.","Fatty Acids, Glutarates, HL-60 Cells, Humans, Isocitrate Dehydrogenase, Isotope Labeling, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Lipid Metabolism, Mutation",yes,no,we,yes,SSA,30366412.0, Stable Isotope Labeling Highlights Enhanced Fatty Acid and Lipid Metabolism in Human Acute Myeloid Leukemia ,yes,no,yes,Unknown,,False

Recent years have witnessed the importance of metabolism transformation in cancer cell malignancies maintenance. Aberrant cancer cell metabolism is considered to be the hallmark of cancer. Our previous studies demonstrated that KL played negative roles in colon cancer cell proliferation and metastasis. However, its role in the cancer cell reprogramming has seldom been reported.

Results: Patients with lower KL expression exhibited higher 18F-FDG uptake (P < 0.05), indicating that KL might participate in aerobic glycolysis regulation. In vitro assay by using colon cancer cell lines further supported this observation. By overexpressing KL in HTC116 and SW480 cells, we observed that the glycolysis was inhibited and the mitochondrial respiration increased, indicating that KL was a negative regulator of aerobic glycolysis. To seek for the underlying mechanisms, we tried to dig out the relation between KL and HIF1Î± signaling pathway, and found that KL negatively regulated HIF1Î± protein level and transcriptional activity. Western blot analysis showed that KL overexpression negatively regulated ERK pathway, and KL regulated aerobic glycolysis in part through its regulation of ERK/ HIF1Î± axis._x000D_

16293608,Identification of glucocorticoid-response genes in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia,"The ability of glucocorticoids (GCs) to kill lymphoid cells led to their inclusion in essentially all chemotherapy protocols for lymphoid malignancies, particularly childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). GCs mediate apoptosis via their cognate receptor and subsequent alterations in gene expression. Previous investigations, including expression profiling studies with subgenome microarrays in model systems, have led to a number of attractive, but conflicting, hypotheses that have never been tested in a clinical setting. Here, we present a comparative whole-genome expression profiling approach using lymphoblasts (purified at 3 time points) from 13 GC-sensitive children undergoing therapy for ALL. For comparisons, expression profiles were generated from an adult patient with ALL, peripheral blood lymphocytes from GC-exposed healthy donors, GC-sensitive and -resistant ALL cell lines, and mouse thymocytes treated with GCs in vivo and in vitro. This generated an essentially complete list of GC-regulated candidate genes in clinical settings and experimental systems, allowing immediate analysis of any gene for its potential significance to GC-induced apoptosis. Our analysis argued against most of the model-based hypotheses and instead identified a small number of novel candidate genes, including PFKFB2, a key regulator of glucose metabolism; ZBTB16, a putative transcription factor; and SNF1LK, a protein kinase implicated in cell-cycle regulation.","Adolescent, Aged, Animals, Apoptosis, Child, Child, Preschool, Drug Resistance, Neoplasm, Female, Gene Expression Profiling, Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic, Glucocorticoids, Humans, Male, Mice, Neoplasm Proteins, Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis, Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma, Tumor Cells, Cultured",yes,no,we,yes,SSA,16293608.0, Identification of glucocorticoid-response genes in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia ,no,no,yes,Unknown,,False

33621196,Transcription factor ELK1 accelerates aerobic glycolysis to enhance osteosarcoma chemoresistance through miR-134/PTBP1 signaling cascade,"Osteosarcoma is a malignancy that primarily affects children and young adults. The poor survival is largely attributed to acquisition of chemoresistance. Thus, the current study aimed to elucidate the role of ELK1/miR-134/PTBP1 signaling cascade in osteosarcoma chemoresistance. Doxorubicin (DXR)-resistant human osteosarcoma cells were initially self-established by continuous exposure of MG-63, U2OS and HOS cells to increasing DXR doses. Osteosarcoma chemoresistance in vitro was evaluated using CCK-8 assays and EdU staining. Aerobic glycolysis was evaluated by lactic acid production, glucose consumption, ATP levels, and Western blot analysis of GLUT3, HK2 and PDK1 proteins. The nude mice were injected with 5.0 mg/kg DXR following the subcutaneous transplantation of osteosarcomas. PTBP1 was upregulated in tumor tissues derived from non-responders to DXR treatment and correlated with patient poor survival. PTBP1 enhanced chemoresistance in cultured osteosarcoma cells in vitro and in vivo by increasing aerobic glycolysis. Additionally, miR-134 inhibited translation of PTBP1. ELK1 bound to miR-134 promoter and inhibited its expression. Overexpressed ELK1 enhanced chemoresistance and increased aerobic glycolysis by downregulating miR-134 and upregulating PTBP1 in DXR-resistant cells. Altogether, the key findings of the present study highlight ELK1/miR-134/PTBP1 signaling cascade as a novel molecular mechanism underlying the acquisition of osteosarcoma chemoresistance.","Antibiotics, Antineoplastic, Cell Line, Tumor, Down-Regulation, Doxorubicin, Drug Resistance, Neoplasm, Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoproteins, Humans, MicroRNAs, Osteosarcoma, Polypyrimidine Tract-Binding Protein, Up-Regulation, Warburg Effect, Oncologic, ets-Domain Protein Elk-1",yes,no,Unknown,yes,SSA,33621196.0, Transcription factor ELK1 accelerates aerobic glycolysis to enhance osteosarcoma chemoresistance through miR-134/PTBP1 signaling cascade ,no,no,yes,not specified,,False
17662957,Membrane fragmentation by an amyloidogenic fragment of human Islet Amyloid Polypeptide detected by solid-state NMR spectroscopy of membrane nanotubes,"A key factor in the development of Type II diabetes is the loss of insulin producing pancreatic beta-cells. The amyloidogenic human Islet Amyloid Polypeptide (hIAPP also known as human amylin) is believed to play a crucial role in this biological process. Previous studies have shown that hIAPP forms small aggregates that kill beta-cells by disrupting the cellular membrane. In this study, we report membrane fragmentation by hIAPP using solid-state NMR experiments on nanotube arrays of anodic aluminum oxide containing aligned phospholipid membranes. In a narrow concentration range of hIAPP, an isotropic (31)P chemical shift signal indicative of the peptide-induced membrane fragmentation was detected. Solid-state NMR results suggest that membrane fragmentation is related to peptide aggregation as the presence of Congo Red, an inhibitor of amyloid formation, prevented membrane fragmentation and the non-amyloidogenic rat-IAPP did not cause membrane fragmentation. The disappearance of membrane fragmentation at higher concentrations of hIAPP suggests an alternate kinetic pathway to fibril formation in which membrane fragmentation is inhibited.","Aluminum Oxide, Amyloid, Dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine, Humans, Islets of Langerhans, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, Membrane Fluidity, Membrane Lipids, Membranes, Artificial, Molecular Conformation, Nanotubes, Peptide Fragments, Permeability, Porosity",yes,yes,unk,yes,SSA,17662957.0, Membrane fragmentation by an amyloidogenic fragment of human Islet Amyloid Polypeptide detected by solid-state NMR spectroscopy of membrane nanotubes ,no,yes,yes,Unknown,,False

Circ_0000442 was reported to inhibit the progression of BC, and this study was designed to explore the novel functional mechanism of circ_0000442 in BC. The expression analysis for circ_0000442, microRNA-1229-3p (miR-1229-3p) and zinc finger and BTB domain containing 1 (ZBTB1) was performed using the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Dual-luciferase reporter assay was used to affirm the target interaction. Cell proliferation was examined using Edu assay and colony formation assay. Cell migration and invasion were assessed by transwell assay. Flow cytometry was applied for the detection of cell apoptosis. Glycolysis was analyzed using the detection kits to measure the glucose consumption and lactate production. The protein expression levels were determined by western blot. The role of circ_0000442 in BC in vivo was explored using tumor xenograft assay. Circ_0000442 expression was downregulated and miR-1229-3p expression was upregulated in BC tissues and cells. Circ_0000442 directly interacted with miR-1229-3p. Circ_0000442 repressed proliferation, migration, invasion and glycolysis but promoted apoptosis in BC cells. The anti-tumor role of circ_0000442 was attributed to the sponge effect on miR-1229-3p. ZBTB1 was a downstream target for miR-1229-3p. Downregulation of miR-1229-3p blocked the malignant behaviors in BC cells by elevating the expression of ZBTB1. Circ_0000442 regulated the ZBTB1 level by targeting miR-1229-3p, and it inhibited tumor growth of BC in vivo by mediating the miR-1229-3p/ZBTB1 axis. All evidence unraveled that circ_0000442 impeded the progression of BC by sponging miR-1229-3p to evoke the ZBTB1 expression upregulation.Â© 2022.

31894252,Upregulation of AGR2vH facilitates cholangiocarcinomaÂ cell survival under endoplasmic reticulum stress viaÂ theÂ activation of the unfolded protein response pathway,"Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is an epithelial cell malignancy arising within the biliary tree in the liver. CCA is usually diagnosed at an advanced stage, subsequent to developing with metastasis. Recently, anterior gradientâ€‘2 (AGR2) was characterized as one of the most highly upregulated genes among all metastasisâ€‘associated genes in highly metastatic CCA cell lines. Previous reports have demonstrated that AGR2 is required for triggering the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway to support cancer cell survival, particularly under endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress conditions. A previous study identified an AGR2 short isoform generated by aberrant splicing, AGR2vH, which contributed to the metastatic phenotype of CCA cells. The aim of the present study was to determine the function of AGR2vH in UPR pathway activation to support cancer cell survivability and apoptosis evasion. Subsequent to experimentally inducing ER stress in AGR2vHâ€‘overexpressing CCA cells using tunicamycin, the UPR pathway was activated by the upregulation of UPR marker genes (activating transcription factor 6, eukaryotic initiation factor 2a and spliced Xâ€‘box binding protein 1), UPR proteins [binding immunoglobulin protein/glucoseâ€‘regulated protein (GRP)78 kDa and phosphorylated eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2a] and UPR downstream targets (GRP94). In addition, the results were verified by AGR2vH knockdown using specific small interfering RNAs. Under ER stress conditions, the overexpression of AGR2vH reduced the number of apoptotic cells by decreasing caspaseâ€‘3/7 activity and downregulating C/EBP homologous protein mRNA and Bâ€‘cell lymphomaâ€‘2 (Bclâ€‘2)â€‘associated X protein expression, whereas the Bclâ€‘2 protein was upregulated, resulting in a higher number of viable cells. The results of the present study support the previous data that indicate that an oncogenic AGR2vH isoform may not only promote metastasisâ€‘associated phenotypes, but also CCA cell survival and apoptosis evasion, thereby favoring cancer progression.","Bile Duct Neoplasms, Cell Line, Tumor, Cell Survival, Cholangiocarcinoma, Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress, Humans, Mucoproteins, Oncogene Proteins, Protein Isoforms, Unfolded Protein Response, Up-Regulation",yes,no,ea,yes,SSA,31894252.0, Upregulation of AGR2vH facilitates cholangiocarcinoma cell survival under endoplasmic reticulum stress via the activation of the unfolded protein response pathway ,no,no,yes,not specified,,False

Because thiamine regulates intracellular glucose metabolism and corrects for multiple damaging effects of high glucose, we hypothesized that variants in specific thiamine transporters are associated with risk of severe retinopathy and/or severe nephropathy because they modify an individual's ability to achieve sufficiently high intracellular thiamine levels. We tested 134 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in two thiamine transporters (SLC19A2/3) and their transcription factors (SP1/2) for an association with severe retinopathy or nephropathy or their combination in the FinnDiane cohort. Subsequently, the results were examined for replication in the DCCT/EDIC and Wisconsin Epidemiologic Study of Diabetic Retinopathy (WESDR) cohorts. We found two SNPs in strong linkage disequilibrium in the SLC19A3 locus associated with a reduced rate of severe retinopathy and the combined phenotype of severe retinopathy and end-stage renal disease. The association for the combined phenotype reached genome-wide significance in a meta-analysis that included the WESDR cohort. These findings suggest that genetic variations in SLC19A3 play an important role in the pathogenesis of severe diabetic retinopathy and nephropathy and may explain why some individuals with type 1 diabetes are less prone than others to develop microvascular complications.","Adult, Case-Control Studies, Cytoprotection, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1, Diabetic Angiopathies, Diabetic Nephropathies, Diabetic Retinopathy, Female, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, Genome-Wide Association Study, Humans, Male, Membrane Transport Proteins, Meta-Analysis as Topic, Middle Aged, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",yes,yes,unk,yes,U,26718501.0, Variation in SLC19A3 and Protection From Microvascular Damage in Type 1 Diabetes ,yes,yes,yes,"we, na",,False

34265237,Regulatory variants in TCF7L2 are associated with thoracic aortic aneurysm,"Thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) is characterized by dilation of the aortic root or ascending/descending aorta. TAA is a heritable disease that can be potentially life threatening. While 10%-20% of TAA cases are caused by rare, pathogenic variants in single genes, the origin of the majority of TAA cases remains unknown. A previous study implicated common variants in FBN1 with TAA disease risk. Here, we report a genome-wide scan of 1,351 TAA-affected individuals and 18,295 control individuals from the Cardiovascular Health Improvement Project and Michigan Genomics Initiative at the University of Michigan. We identified a genome-wide significant association with TAA for variants within the third intron of TCF7L2 following replication with meta-analysis of four additional independent cohorts. Common variants in this locus are the strongest known genetic risk factor for type 2 diabetes. Although evidence indicates the presence of different causal variants for TAA and type 2 diabetes at this locus, we observed an opposite direction of effect. The genetic association for TAA colocalizes with an aortic eQTL of TCF7L2, suggesting a functional relationship. These analyses predict an association of higher expression of TCF7L2 with TAA disease risk. In vitro, we show that upregulation of TCF7L2 is associated with BCL2 repression promoting vascular smooth muscle cell apoptosis, a key driver of TAA disease.","Aorta, Aortic Aneurysm, Thoracic, Case-Control Studies, Caspase 3, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2, Endothelial Cells, Gene Expression Regulation, Genome, Human, Genome-Wide Association Study, Humans, Introns, Michigan, Muscle, Smooth, Vascular, Mutation, Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2, Quantitative Trait Loci, Transcription Factor 7-Like 2 Protein, bcl-2-Associated X Protein",yes,yes,unk,yes,U,34265237.0, Regulatory variants in TCF7L2 are associated with thoracic aortic aneurysm ,yes,yes,yes,Unknown,,False

Sanjappa & Pradeep (Ge-Gen in Chinese), Coptis chinensis Franch (Huang-Lian), and Cinnamomum cassia (L.) J. Presl (Rou-Gui). GGJTW is used for treatment of diabetes in China, reflecting the potent hypoglycemic effect of its ingredients. However, little is known of the hypoglycemic effect of GGJTW and the underlying metabolic mechanism.This study aimed to investigate the hypoglycemic effect of GGJTW in type 2 diabetic rats and the metabolic mechanism of action.Ultra high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole-time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF/MS)-based metabolomics approach was used for monitoring hyperglycaemia induced by high-sugar high-fat fodder and streptozotocin (STZ), and the protective effect of GGJTW. Dynamic fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels, body weight, and biochemical parameters, including lipid levels, hepatic-renal function, and hepatic histopathology were used to confirm the hyperglycaemic toxicity and attenuation effects. An orthogonal partial least squared-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) approach highlighted significant differences in the metabolome of the healthy control, diabetic, and drug-treated rats. The metabolomics pathway analysis (MetPA) and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) database were used to investigate the underlying metabolic pathways.Metabolic profiling revealed 37 metabolites as the most potential biomarker metabolites distinguishing GGJTW-treated rats from model rats. Most of the metabolites were primarily associated with bile acid metabolism and lipid metabolism. The most critical pathway was primary bile acid biosynthesis pathway involving the up-regulation of the levels of cholic acid (CA), chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), taurocholic acid (TCA), glycocholic acid (GCA), taurochenodesoxycholic acid (TCDCA), and taurine.The significantly-altered metabolite levels indicated the hypoglycemic effect of GGJTW on diabetic rats and the underlying metabolic mechanism.

Results: Forty-one patients from 14 participating clinics agreed to participate (25 STD, 16 PTD). All patients completed their 6-class cohort. Both newly diagnosed patients and those living with diabetes for longer found classes useful. Patients generally enjoyed the content, with nutrition favored most. Opinion on mental health topics and skill building varied, but overall deemed valuable. The social aspect of SMAs was seen as the biggest benefit. However, the peer mentor role (PTD only) was not always appreciated. Patient topic order selection and behavioral health as part of the care team (PTD only) were viewed as helpful but not necessary, though guest lecturers were supported by all. Facilitators were mostly seen as supportive and their teaching style agreeable, which contributed considerably to positive experiences. Those who did virtual SMAs had mostly positive views. The format allowed continuation of care that may have been halted due to the pandemic, let people with busy schedules to participate, and in some instances made sharing easier to do. Some would still have preferred an in-person class. Conclusions: Patients found SMAs beneficial, favoring classic diabetes self-management topics over mental health and skill building. The peer mentor role was not always well received, likely due to variations in the peer mentor. Teaching style was very important to satisfaction, and all patients wanted guest speakers with varied expertise. A virtual format was acceptable. .Â© 2021 Annals of Family Medicine, Inc.","COVID-19, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2, Humans, Pandemics, Shared Medical Appointments",no,yes,unk,yes,U,36857158.0," Patient perspectives on diabetes shared medical appointments before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic ",no,yes,yes,Unknown,,False
32127253,Independent pharmacist prescribing of statins for patients with type 2 diabetes: An analysis of enhanced pharmacist prescriptive authority in Idaho,"This study describes the development and patients' perceptions of a community pharmacist-led, statin-prescribing service for patients with diabetes and aims to identify why patients indicated for statin therapy were not prescribed therapy at the time of pharmacist consultation.This pilot service began in 4 community-based Albertsons Companies pharmacies located in western Idaho. Patients eligible for the statin-prescribing service had a current diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, were aged between 40 and 75 years, were currently taking medications to manage their diabetes and had no contraindications to statin therapy.Due to recent law changes in Idaho, pharmacists can now prescribe statins and certain other medications without oversight from a medical provider or the need for a collaborative practice agreement.Patients were identified and contacted by their local community pharmacist to discuss the statin-prescribing service. Once statin therapy was initiated, patients completed a brief, 7-question survey regarding their perceptions of the service.This study evaluated the following: number of patients eligible for the prescribing service, number of patients who received a pharmacist-written statin prescription, and patients' perceptions regarding the service.Of the 64 patients screened, 18 (28%) were eligible for statin therapy. Of those eligible, 6 (33%) accepted pharmacist services and 4 patients started statin treatment. Two patients were prescribed a statin by the community pharmacist, whereas the other 2 patients contacted their primary care provider and requested a statin prescription at the pharmacist's recommendation.Overall, participating patients (nÂ = 4) reported feeling comfortable and satisfied with all aspects of the protocol and their pharmacist's role as a prescriber.This pilot was the first example of community pharmacists independently prescribing statins outside of the clinic setting.

32660331,Genome-wide DNA methylation differences and polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) exposure in a US population,"Exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), an endocrine-disrupting compound, is ubiquitous despite decades-old bans on the manufacture and use of PCBs. Increased exposure to PCBs is associated with adverse health consequences throughout life, including type 2 diabetes and cancer. PCB exposure is also associated with alterations in epigenetic marks and gene transcription, which could lead to adverse health outcomes, but many of these are population-specific. To further investigate the association between PCB and epigenetic marks, DNA methylation was measured at 787,684 CpG sites in 641 peripheral blood samples from the Michigan Polybrominated Biphenyl (PBB) Registry. 1345 CpGs were associated with increased total PCB level after controlling for age, sex, and 24 surrogate variables (FDR < 0.05). These CpGs were enriched in active promoter and transcription associated regions (pÂ <Â 0.05), and in regions around the binding sites for transcription factors involved in xenobiotic metabolism and immune function (FDR < 0.05). PCB exposure also associated with proportions of CD4T, NK, and granulocyte cell types, and with the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (pÂ <Â 0.05), and the estimated effect sizes of PCB on the epigenome were correlated with the effect sizes previously reported in an epigenome-wide study of C-reactive protein (rÂ =Â 0.29; p =Â 2.22e-5), supporting previous studies on the association between PCB and immune dysfunction.

Results: About 56% of the women had hypertension (38% of which was untreated or uncontrolled), 45% had hypercholesterolemia (31% of which was untreated or uncontrolled), and 19% had diabetes (26% of which was untreated or uncontrolled). Multivariable analyses showed that those with a regular physician were less likely than those without a physician to have uncontrolled hypertension (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 0.34, 95% CI 0.13-0.88) and hypercholesterolemia (AOR 0.14, 95% CI 0.04-0.47). Education level was also a significant predictor for uncontrolled hypertension, and physical activity level (measured by total metabolic equivalent [MET] hours) significantly predicted uncontrolled hypercholesterolemia (AOR 1.01, 95% CI 1.001-1.02). For diabetes, race/ethnicity was the main predictor; white women were less likely than other groups to have untreated or uncontrolled diabetes._x000D_

We assessed the effect of the Missouri WISEWOMAN program on the control of high blood pressure, total cholesterol, and blood glucose levels.We calculated the proportion of participants (N = 1,130) with abnormal blood pressure, total cholesterol, or blood glucose levels at an initial screening visit who gained control at a follow-up visit 11 to 18 months later during a 7-year period from June 30, 2005, to June 29, 2012. We used logistic regression to identify sociodemographic characteristics and other factors associated with achieving control.Many WISEWOMAN participants gained control of their blood pressure (41.2%), total cholesterol (24.7%), or blood glucose levels (50.0%). After controlling for sociodemographic factors, smoking status, weight status, medication use, and number of lifestyle interventions, nondiabetic women with stage II hypertension (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.36, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.21-0.60) and diabetic women with stage I (AOR = 0.54, 95% CI = 0.32-0.92) and stage II (AOR = 0.23, 95% CI = 0.07-0.77) hypertension were less likely to achieve control of their blood pressure than nondiabetic women with stage I hypertension. Women aged 45 to 64, women with less than a high school education, women who were obese in the initial visit, women who gained 7% or more of their weight, and women who did not participate in any lifestyle intervention sessions were significantly less likely to achieve total cholesterol control than their counterparts.The Missouri WISEWOMAN program helps many participants achieve control of blood pressure, total cholesterol, and blood glucose levels; the lifestyle intervention is likely to help participants control total cholesterol.

We evaluated 78 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spanning >213 kb in 95 people, from which we selected 64 SNPs for evaluation in 191 Caucasian case subjects from Utah and between 165 and 188 control subjects. Six SNPs showed nominal associations with type 2 diabetes (P = 0.001-0.04), including the nonsynonymous SNP rs1058405 (M67V) in exon 3 and rs11579627 in the 3' flanking region. Only rs1159627 remained significant on permutation testing. The associations were not replicated in 353 African-American case subjects and 182 control subjects, nor were ATF6 SNPs associated with altered insulin secretion or insulin sensitivity in nondiabetic Caucasian individuals. No association with type 2 diabetes was found in a subset of 44 SNPs in Caucasian (n = 2,099), Pima Indian (n = 293), and Chinese (n = 287) samples. Allelic expression imbalance was found in transformed lymphocyte cDNA for 3' untranslated region variants, thus suggesting cis-acting regulatory variants.

2293753,Cardiovascular risk factors and impaired glucose tolerance: the San Luis Valley Diabetes Study,"Cardiovascular risk factor patterns were examined cross-sectionally in 856 Hispanic and Anglo subjects aged 20-74 years enrolled in the population-based San Luis Valley Diabetes Study of Colorado. Risk factor levels and prevalence were compared for 279 individuals with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, 89 with impaired glucose tolerance, and 488 with normal glucose tolerance. Sex-specific comparisons of continuous risk factors were made by diabetic status and ethnicity, adjusting for age using two-way analysis of covariance; similar comparisons of discrete variables were made using logistic regression. A number of vascular, metabolic, lipid, obesity-related, family history, and life-style risk factors for cardiovascular disease were examined. In general, biologic risk factors tended to be more strongly associated with diabetic status, while life-style risk factors varied more by ethnicity. Age-adjusted levels of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, hypertension history, triglyceride, and body mass index were lowest among normal subjects, intermediate for those with impaired glucose tolerance, and highest in subjects with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, while the trend was reversed for high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and its subfractions. Hispanics had lower serum uric acid levels and greater central obesity than Anglos; they were less likely to have a Type A personality, less physically active at work, and more likely to be a current smoker than Anglos. Hispanic males had a lower body mass index and a higher HDL cholesterol level than Anglo males. These results indicate that an adverse cardiovascular risk factor pattern is present not only in subjects with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus but also in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance who are at increased risk of developing diabetes. This suggests that an adverse risk factor pattern may develop concurrently with or prior to the onset of impaired glucose tolerance. Future prospective studies will help to clarify the temporal sequence involved in the development of adverse cardiovascular risk factor patterns and impaired glucose tolerance.","Adult, Aged, Cardiovascular Diseases, Case-Control Studies, Colorado, Cross-Sectional Studies, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2, Ethnicity, Female, Hispanic or Latino, Humans, Male, Mexico, Middle Aged, Prediabetic State, Prevalence, Risk Factors",no,yes,unk,yes,U,2293753.0, Cardiovascular risk factors and impaired glucose tolerance: the San Luis Valley Diabetes Study ,no,yes,yes,"lac, na",,False
7081197,Plasma lipids and diabetes mellitus in an adult community,"Most previous studies of hyperlipidemia in diabetics are based on patients in specialty clinics or reflect an era when diabetics consumed a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet. In this paper, data from a defined adult population aged 20-79 years in an upper middle class community in Southern California, 1972-1974, were used to ascertain the relationship of hyperlipidemia to diabetes in a current community-based population. All (n = 358) diabetics as defined by history and/or fasting hyperglycemia (fasting plasma glucose, greater than or equal to 140 mg/dl) were compared with all (n = 4387) nondiabetics defined as euglycemic (fasting plasma glucose, less than 110 mg/dl) with no personal or family history of diabetes. In both men and women 50 years of age and older, the mean cholesterol level and the prevelance of categorical hypercholesterolemia were not significantly different in diabetics vs. nondiabetics, whereas the mean triglyceride level and the prevalence of categorical hypertriglyceridemia were significantly higher in diabetics vs. nondiabetics. Case-control comparisons of 356 diabetics matched for age and obesity with 356 nondiabetics confirmed the significantly higher triglyceride levels in diabetes. Conversely, hypertriglyceridemia was associated with diabetes in 29 per cent of nonobese men and 25 per cent of obese men, and in 10 per cent of non-obese women and 21 per cent of obese women. The biologic mechanism of hypertriglyceridemia in diabetics is discussed.","Adult, Aged, California, Cholesterol, Diabetes Complications, Diabetes Mellitus, Female, Humans, Hyperlipoproteinemias, Male, Middle Aged, Obesity, Triglycerides",no,yes,unk,yes,U,7081197.0, Plasma lipids and diabetes mellitus in an adult community ,no,yes,yes,Unknown,,False

Within the context of an aging population, this will impose significant individual and societal burden, making the development of prevention programs imperative.This pilot study examines the effects of the Diabetes Exercise and Healthy Lifestyle Service, a 24-week intervention program, on cardiovascular, metabolic regulation and cognitive function in adults with T2DM.Seventeen middle-aged participants provided blood samples for biological markers, underwent cognitive testing and a physical stress test pre- and post-intervention. Cognitive performance was evaluated using the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT), Digit Symbol Substitution Tasl (DSST) and fluency test.Adjusted models reveal participants displayed increased cardiovascular fitness (VO2 peak: Mchange=4.09 mLâˆ™kgâˆ™min(-1) SE=1.4), peak heart rate (Mchange= 9.28 beatsâ‹…min(-1) SE=2.68) and change in heart rate (Mchange=10.71 SE=1.76) in response to the stress test (ps<0.05) following the 24-week intervention. A decrease in body mass index (BMI) (Mchange=Â -1.03 SE=0.40) and depressive symptomatology (CES-D: MchangeÂ =Â -3.62 SE=1.44) was also found (ps<0.05).

Animal studies generally support a relation between high-fat diets and development of insulin resistance. However, conclusive epidemiologic evidence is lacking. To further investigate the role of dietary fat and carbohydrate as potential risk factors for the onset of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, current diet was assessed among a geographically based group of 1,317 subjects without a prior diagnosis of diabetes who were seen in the period from 1984 to 1988 in two countries in southern Colorado. In this study, 24-hour diet recalls were reported prior to an oral glucose tolerance test. Persons with previously undiagnosed diabetes (n = 70) and impaired glucose tolerance (n = 171) were each compared with confirmed normal controls (n = 1,076). The adjusted odds ratios relating a 40-g/day increase in fat intake to non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and impaired glucose tolerance were 1.51 (95% confidence interval 0.85-2.67) and 1.62 (95% confidence interval 1.09-2.41), respectively. Restricting cases to diabetic persons with fasting glucose greater than 140 mg/dl and persons with impaired glucose tolerance confirmed on follow-up, the odds ratios increased to 3.03 (95% confidence interval 1.07-8.62) and 2.67 (95% confidence interval 1.33-5.36), respectively.

Linear mixed models were used to compare repeated measures of the metabolic measures and evaluate the rates of change in individuals with and without dysfunction.Of the 613 participants, 331 (54%) had executive dysfunction, 202 (33%) had memory dysfunction, and 96 (16%) had both. Over a median of 2 years, participants with executive or memory dysfunction did not exhibit significantly poorer metabolic control than those without executive function or memory type cognitive dysfunction.Cognitive dysfunction in the mild range did not seem to affect diabetes mellitus control parameters in this multiethnic cohort of older adults with diabetes mellitus, although it cannot be excluded that cognitive impairment was overcome through assistance from formal or informal caregivers.

Humanistic outcomes included the mental and physical components of the 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12) and patient satisfaction with health services related to their diabetes care. Screening parameters included the proportion of patients meeting Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set expectations for patients with diabetes. Productivity and health resource use were also assessed based on patient responses to survey questions.After 1 year of enrollment, patients in the DiabetesCARE program achieved improved clinical outcomes compared with baseline, as evidenced by statistically significant reductions in A1C, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and total cholesterol. Statistically significant increases were seen in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and the proportion of patients obtaining influenza vaccine, yearly screenings for lipid level assessment, screenings for kidney disease, and eye examinations.

15840553,Correlation between lipoprotein(a) and other risk factors for cardiovascular disease and diabetes in Cherokee Indians: the Cherokee Diabetes Study,"To study the age and gender effects on the distribution of lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] and its relationship with other cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes risk factors in the participants of the Cherokee Diabetes Study (CDS) (1995-2000).The CDS is a population based cross-sectional study of diabetes and its risk factors in Cherokee Indians aged 5 to 40 years of Oklahoma. Lp(a) levels were measured in 2205 participants.The median Lp(a) (mg/dL) levels in the females were not significantly different among four age groups (5-9, 10-19, 20-29, and 30-40 years). However, the 20- to 29-year-old males had significantly lower Lp(a) levels than the males 10 to 19 and 30 to 40 years old. Females had significantly higher Lp(a) levels than males in the 20- to 29-year-old age group only. In the 5- to 19-year-old children/adolescents, Lp(a) levels were significantly negatively correlated with the degree of Indian heritage (DIH) and positively correlated with total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoproteins (LDL), and apolipoprotein B (apoB) in girls, but not in boys. In the young adults aged 20 to 29 years, Lp(a) levels were significantly correlated with DIH, body mass index (BMI), waist-hip ratio (WHR), percentage of body fat (PBF), systolic blood pressure (SBP), triglycerides (TG), 2-hour plasma glucose (2hPG), and insulin in males, and DIH, PBF, TC, LDL, TG, and insulin in females. In adults aged 30 to 40 years, Lp(a) levels were significantly correlated with DIH, TG, and LDL in females, and DIH and insulin in males.In the girls, Lp(a) levels appear to be associated with several CVD and diabetes risk factors at an early age (5-19 years), while in the boys, the association occurs at older ages (> 19 years). There are significant age and gender differences regarding the distribution of Lp(a) and its correlates in the 5 to 9, 10 to 19, and 20 to 29-year-old age groups, but the differences tend to be weaker in the 30- to 40-year-old age group. For the same age and gender groups, Lp(a) concentrations in Cherokee Indians were much lower than those reported in blacks and slightly lower than those in whites. In Cherokee Indians, the Lp(a) levels were consistently and positively correlated with LDL, and negatively correlated with DIH, TG, and insulin.","Adolescent, Age Distribution, Body Mass Index, Cardiovascular Diseases, Child, Child, Preschool, Cross-Sectional Studies, Diabetes Mellitus, Female, Humans, Indians, North American, Lipoprotein(a), Male, Oklahoma, Regression Analysis, Risk Factors, Sex Distribution",no,yes,unk,yes,U,15840553.0, Correlation between lipoprotein(a) and other risk factors for cardiovascular disease and diabetes in Cherokee Indians: the Cherokee Diabetes Study ,no,yes,yes,Unknown,,False
7772075,"The relationship of APOE polymorphism and cholesterol levels in normoglycemic and diabetic subjects in a biethnic population from the San Luis Valley, Colorado","We have determined apolipoprotein E (apoE = protein, APOE = gene) polymorphism and its relationship with total cholesterol (TC), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglyceride levels in normoglycemic Hispanics (n = 446) and non-Hispanic whites (NHWs) (n = 659) as well as in diabetic Hispanics (n = 235) and NHWs (n = 116) from the San Luis Valley, Colorado. Effects were estimated separately for each group, and within each group men and women were analyzed separately; women were further categorized into pre- and post-menopausal status. The distribution of the APOE genotype pattern was comparable between the NHW normoglycemics and diabetics but it was significantly different among Hispanic normoglycemics and diabetics (P < 0.005). In the normoglycemic sample the APOE allele frequencies were significantly different between the two ethnic groups: the APOE*2 (0.09 vs. 0.05; P < 0.01) and APOE*4 (0.15 vs. 0.09; P < 0.002) allele frequencies were higher while the APOE*3 (0.76 vs. 0.86; P < 0.0001) allele frequency was lower in NHWs than in Hispanics. Significant variability among the three common APOE genotypes (3-2, 3-3, and 4-3) was observed for TC and LDL-C in normoglycemic Hispanic women (P = 0.09 and P = 0.03) but not in Hispanic men. In normoglycemic NHWs, however, significant mean differences among APOE genotypes were observed for TC and LDL-C in both women (P < 0.0001 and P < 0.0001) and men (P = 0.009 and P = 0.01). In Hispanic females, the APOE polymorphism accounted for 5.6% and 7.6% of the phenotypic variance for TC and LDL-C, respectively. In NHW females, the APOE polymorphism explained 10.2% of the phenotypic variance for TC and LDL-C, and in NHW males these values were 6.2% and 7.5%, respectively. There was no evidence of physiologic interaction between the APOE polymorphism and menopause status in affecting TC and LDL-C in NHW women (P = 0.65 and P = 0.55) but a suggestion of interaction was observed in Hispanic women for TC and LDL-C (P = 0.11 and 0.07). After the Hispanic women were stratified into pre- and postmenopausal groups, the effect of the APOE polymorphism on TC and LDL-C was significant only in the premenopausal group.

20396599,"Dietary fat reduction behaviors among African American, American Indian, and white older adults with diabetes","Dietary self-management of diabetes is often difficult for older adults to practice, particularly in rural communities. We describe patterns and correlates of dietary fat reduction among older rural adults with diabetes of any type. In-home interviews were conducted with a multiethnic random sample of 701 adults â‰¥ 65 with diabetes from two North Carolina counties. The Fat and Fiber Behavior Questionnaire was used to measure dietary behaviors. Separate multiple linear regressions assessed effects of gender, ethnicity, and diabetes education. In general, scores were more favorable for practices that involved modifying food preparation (e.g., avoiding frying) and less favorable for practices that involved changing foods consumed (e.g., substituting fruits and vegetables as desserts or snacks). American Indians and African Americans had less favorable scores than whites, and diabetes education was associated with greater fat restriction for women than men. Older men and ethnic minorities with diabetes should be targeted for dietary change education.","Aged, Black or African American, Cross-Sectional Studies, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2, Diet, Fat-Restricted, Dietary Fats, Female, Health Behavior, Humans, Indians, North American, Male, North Carolina, Rural Population, Self Care, White People",no,yes,unk,yes,U,20396599.0," Dietary fat reduction behaviors among African American, American Indian, and white older adults with diabetes ",no,yes,yes,Unknown,,False

6829548,A community study of high density lipoproteins in adult noninsulin-dependent diabetics,"It is generally accepted that high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) is protective against cardiovascular disease, and that diabetics are at a significant excess risk of cardiovascular disease. Previous studies of HDL-C levels in noninsulin-dependent diabetics have reported divergent results, possibly due to case selection or failure to adjust for covariables known to effect HDL-C, such as obesity, cigarette smoking, alcohol intake, exercise, or exogenous estrogen use. The authors compared 97 adult noninsulin-dependent diabetics identified by history or fasting hyperglycemia from a population survey in southern California with 194 age- and sex-matched euglycemic controls from the same community. HDL-C levels were significantly lower in noninsulin-dependent diabetics of both sexes, and these differences persisted after adjustment for obesity, cigarette smoking, alcohol, exercise, and estrogen use in women. These data support the concept that reduced levels of HDL-C may be one mechanism whereby diabetics experience an excess risk of cardiovascular disease. In contrast to the published literature, HDL-C levels were not significantly different in diabetics treated with tolbutamide vs. diet therapy. This finding does not support the suggestion that the excess risk of cardiovascular disease mortality in diabetics assigned to tolbutamide reported from the University Group Diabetes Program was a consequence of tolbutamide-induced reductions in HDL-C.","Aged, Alcohol Drinking, Body Weight, California, Diabetes Complications, Diabetes Mellitus, Female, Hormones, Humans, Lipoproteins, Male, Middle Aged, Obesity, Physical Exertion, Smoking",no,yes,unk,yes,U,6829548.0, A community study of high density lipoproteins in adult noninsulin-dependent diabetics ,no,yes,yes,Unknown,,False

Twenty-four semi-structured interviews were completed with primary care providers (n=14) and endocrine specialty clinicians (n=10) across sixteen clinics in North Carolina. Interview topics included: (1) current glucose monitoring approaches and diabetes management strategies for people with diabetes (2) barriers and unintended consequences encountered with respect to diabetes self-management, and (3) innovative strategies developed to overcome barriers. Interview transcripts were coded using qualitative analysis software and analyzed to identify cross-cutting themes and differences between participants. Primary care providers and endocrine specialty clinicians reported that people with diabetes experienced increased mental health symptoms, increased financial challenges and positive and negative changes in self-care routines due to COVID-19. To offer support, primary care providers and endocrine specialty providers focused discussions on lifestyle management and utilized telemedicine to connect with patients. Additionally, endocrine specialty clinicians helped patients access financial assistance programs. Findings indicate that people with diabetes experienced unique challenges to self-management during the pandemic and providers responded with targeted support strategies. Future research should explore the effectiveness of these provider interventions as the pandemic continues to evolve.Copyright Â© 2022 Hale, Cameron, Donahue, Vu, Leeman, Johnson, Richman, Rees and Young.",,no,yes,unk,yes,U,36992778.0, Clinical Team Response to the Impact of COVID-19 on Diabetes Self-Management: Findings From a Qualitative Study ,no,yes,yes,Unknown,,False

Data on coffee consumption, other dietary variables from a 24-hour dietary recall, and other potentially confounding variables collected in 1965 were correlated with serum cholesterol at that examination and at examination six years later. The mean coffee and tea consumption was 3.4 and 1.8 cups/day, respectively. Those consuming no coffee had a mean serum cholesterol of 210 mg/dl, while that of those drinking 9+ cups/day was 220 mg/dl (no such relationship was apparent with tea or cola). The relationship of coffee consumption and serum cholesterol with potentially confounding variables including body mass index, cigarette smoking, diastolic blood pressure, alcohol consumption, physical activity index, serum glucose, serum uric acid, education, age, and fat consumption was examined. When these variables were entered into a multiple regression equation with coffee consumption, a significant relationship between coffee consumption and serum cholesterol (p less than 0.001) persisted, as did that between baseline coffee consumption and serum cholesterol six years later (p less than 0.001). There was no significant relationship between tea or cola, the other major caffeine contributors to the diet, and baseline serum cholesterol. Thus, this analysis indicates a significant positive relationship between coffee consumption and serum cholesterol which is not present with other sources of caffeine.","Aged, Alcohol Drinking, Blood Pressure, Caffeine, Cardiovascular Diseases, Cholesterol, Coffee, Diet Surveys, Epidemiologic Methods, Hawaii, Humans, Japan, Male, Mental Recall, Middle Aged, Regression Analysis, Smoking",no,no,unk,yes,U,3953543.0," Coffee, caffeine, and serum cholesterol in Japanese men in Hawaii ",no,no,yes,ea,,False

29335891,Serum Bilirubin Concentration is Associated with Left Ventricular Remodeling in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A Cohort Study,"Previous studies have shown that serum bilirubin concentration is inversely associated with the risk of cardiovascular disease. The relationship between serum bilirubin concentration and left ventricular geometry, however, has not been investigated in patients with diabetes mellitus.In this cohort study, 158 asymptomatic patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus without overt heart disease were enrolled. Left ventricular structure and function were assessed using echocardiography. Serum bilirubin concentration, glycemic control, lipid profile, and other clinical characteristics were evaluated, and their association with left ventricular geometry was determined. Patients with New York Heart Association Functional Classification greater than I, left ventricular ejection fraction less than 50%, history of coronary artery disease, severe valvulopathy, chronic atrial fibrillation, or creatinine clearance less than 30Â ml/min, and those receiving insulin treatment, were excluded.Univariate analyses showed that relative wall thickness (RWT) was significantly correlated with diastolic blood pressure (PÂ =Â 0.003), HbA1c (PÂ =Â 0.024), total cholesterol (PÂ =Â 0.043), urinary albumin (PÂ =Â 0.023), and serum bilirubin concentration (PÂ =Â 0.009).

25622076,A life-span behavioral mechanism relating childhood conscientiousness to adult clinical health,"To investigate a life-span health-behavior mechanism relating childhood personality to adult clinical health.Childhood Big Five personality traits at mean age 10, adult Big Five personality traits, adult clinically assessed dysregulation at mean age 51 (a summary of dysregulated blood glucose, blood pressure, and lipids), and a retrospective, cumulative measure of life-span health-damaging behavior (lifetime smoking, physical inactivity, and body mass index from age 20) were assessed in the Hawaii Personality and Health Cohort (N = 759). Structural equation modeling was used to test the conceptual model with direct and indirect paths from a childhood Conscientiousness factor to an adult Conscientiousness factor, life-span health-damaging behaviors, educational attainment, adult cognitive ability, and adult clinical health.For both men and women, childhood Conscientiousness influenced health-damaging behaviors through educational attainment, and life-span health-damaging behaviors predicted dysregulation. Childhood Conscientiousness predicted adult Conscientiousness, which did not predict any other variables in the model. For men, childhood Conscientiousness predicted dysregulation through educational attainment and health-damaging behaviors. For women, childhood Conscientiousness predicted dysregulation through educational attainment and adult cognitive ability.Assessing cumulative life-span health behaviors is a novel approach to the study of health-behavior mechanisms.

28095749,Obese adolescents with polycystic ovarian syndrome have elevated cardiovascular disease risk markers,"Women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) have evidence of subclinical cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, insulin resistance, an important factor in the development of CVD in adults, is common in adolescents with PCOS, yet data in adolescents are limited. Therefore, we sought to measure insulin resistance and CVD markers in obese youth with and without PCOS. Thirty-six PCOS and 17 non-PCOS adolescent girls who were obese, sedentary, and non-hypertensive were recruited from clinics located within the Children's Hospital Colorado. Following 3 days of controlled diet and restricted exercise, fasting plasma samples were obtained prior to a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp. PCOS girls were more insulin resistant than controls (glucose infusion rate 5.24Â±1.86 mg/kg/min vs 9.10Â±2.69; p<0.001). Girls with PCOS had blood pressure in the normal range, but had greater carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) (0.49Â±0.07 mm vs 0.44Â±0.06; p=0.038), beta stiffness index (5.1Â±1.3 U vs 4.4Â±0.9; p=0.037), and reduced arterial compliance (1.95Â±0.47 mm2/mmHg Ã— 10-1 vs 2.13Â±0.43; p=0.047). PCOS girls had a normal mean lipid profile, yet had a more atherogenic lipoprotein cholesterol distribution and had persistent elevations of free fatty acids despite hyperinsulinemia (68Â±28 Î¼mol/mL vs 41Â±10; p=0.001), both potential contributors to CVD. Free fatty acid concentrations correlated best with all CVD markers. In summary, adolescent girls with PCOS have greater cIMT and stiffer arteries than girls without PCOS, perhaps related to altered lipid metabolism, even when clinical measures of blood pressure and cholesterol profiles are 'normal'. Therefore, management of adolescent PCOS should include assessment of CVD risk factor development.","Adolescent, Biomarkers, Blood Glucose, Blood Pressure, Cardiovascular Diseases, Carotid Intima-Media Thickness, Case-Control Studies, Child, Colorado, Female, Glucose Clamp Technique, Hospitals, Pediatric, Humans, Inflammation Mediators, Insulin, Insulin Resistance, Lipids, Pediatric Obesity, Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, Risk Assessment, Risk Factors, Vascular Stiffness, Young Adult",no,no,unk,yes,U,28095749.0, Obese adolescents with polycystic ovarian syndrome have elevated cardiovascular disease risk markers ,no,no,yes,Unknown,,False
17417734,Assessing obesity and other related health problems of mentally ill Hispanic patients in an urban outpatient setting,"This paper describes the role of an agency Clinical Director in developing a project to assess and begin to address obesity-related health problems of patients treated in a community-based mental health clinic in New York City. After a five year review of outpatient deaths revealed a high rate of deaths from cardiovascular and diabetes-related issues, the Clinical Director assembled a group of clinicians, researchers, and administrative staff to design a pilot project to assess health and nutrition status of primarily Hispanic day treatment patients with severe and persistent mental illness.About 69 of the 105 patients at the clinic were assessed by chart review, interview about nutritional habits and medical care, and somatic measurements for blood pressure, weight, girth, body mass index (BMI), glucose and lipid levels.Patients were predominantly between the ages of 25 and 64 years, 51% were female, and 78% were Hispanic. Around 57% were diagnosed with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders, 86% were receiving antipsychotic medications, and 25% were on two or more antipsychotics. Only 11% of the women and 41% of the men had normal weight. A total of 29% of the women and 18% of the men were overweight (BMI = 25-29.9); and an additional 60% of the women and 41% of the men were obese (BMI > or = 30). Atypical antipsychotic treatment was significantly associated with obesity (BMI > or = 30) (chi sq = 5.5, df = 1, P < 0.025). Using American Heart Association criteria, waist measurements showed significant abdominal obesity among female patients. Blood pressure was elevated in 77% of the patients: 45% were pre-hypertensive with BP 120-139/80-89 and 32% were hypertensive with BP > or = 140/90. About 53% had elevated random blood glucoses (>110 mg/dl). On the positive side, patients generally had had recent medical follow-up, and most had adequate cooking facilities.This project revealed that these predominantly Hispanic, severely mentally ill individuals were at high risk for cardiac illness, highlighting the need for developing culturally-sensitive interventions in urban outpatient psychiatric settings. Findings were disseminated in educational presentations and clinical discussions, and have mobilized an institutional effort to significantly improve medical monitoring for these patients.","Adult, Ambulatory Care Facilities, Body Mass Index, Health Status, Hispanic or Latino, Humans, Mental Disorders, Middle Aged, Obesity, Severity of Illness Index, Surveys and Questionnaires, Urban Population",no,yes,unk,yes,U,17417734.0, Assessing obesity and other related health problems of mentally ill Hispanic patients in an urban outpatient setting ,no,yes,yes,lac,,False
8457259,Impact of apolipoprotein E polymorphism in determining interindividual variation in total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein cholesterol in Hispanics and non-Hispanic whites,"The extent of apolipoprotein E (apo E) polymorphism and its effect on eight quantitative risk factors for coronary heart disease (total cholesterol; low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol; total high density lipoprotein and its subfractions, HDL2 and HDL3; triglycerides; fasting glucose and fasting insulin) has been determined in 238 randomly selected Hispanics (120 males and 118 females) and 201 non-Hispanic whites (NHWs) (105 males and 96 females) from the San Luis Valley, Colorado. The frequencies for the E * 2, E * 3 and E * 4 alleles were 0.048, 0.853 and 0.099, respectively, in Hispanics and 0.080, 0.783 and 0.137, respectively, in NHWs. Relatively low frequency of the E * 2 and E * 4 alleles in Hispanics compared with NHWs is consistent with the genetic and anthropologic data that Hispanics have substantial Amerindian admixture. The impact of apo E polymorphism on each quantitative trait was estimated after adjusting for concomitant variables including age, cigarette smoking and body mass index in both genders and pre- or post-menopause status in females. The distribution of eight quantitative traits was analyzed among three common apo E phenotypes, 3-2, 3-3 and 4-3. In Hispanics, significant variability among apo E phenotypes was observed for total cholesterol (P = 0.001) in females only and the apo E polymorphism accounts for 12.4% variation in total cholesterol and 15.2% variation in LDL-cholesterol. In NHWs, significant mean differences among apo E phenotypes were observed for total cholesterol in both males (P = 0.007) and females (P = 0.0004). In NHW males and females, the apo E polymorphism explained 9.2% and 12.4%, respectively, of the variation in total cholesterol, and 15.1% and 6.6%, respectively, of the variation in LDL-cholesterol. In NHWs, borderline significance levels were also noted for phenotype specific differences in HDL2-cholesterol in males (P = 0.04) and females (P = 0.05), for total HDL cholesterol in females (P = 0.02) and HDL3-cholesterol in females (P = 0.06). While the estimated effects of the apo E polymorphism on quantitative traits differ somewhat between Hispanics and non-Hispanic whites, this probably reflects the overall difference in frequencies of the less common alleles in the Hispanics rather than a biological difference in the effects of these alleles on lipid metabolism.","Alleles, Apolipoproteins E, Cholesterol, Cholesterol, LDL, Colorado, Female, Gene Frequency, Hispanic or Latino, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Phenotype, Polymorphism, Genetic",yes,no,unk,yes,U,8457259.0, Impact of apolipoprotein E polymorphism in determining interindividual variation in total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein cholesterol in Hispanics and non-Hispanic whites ,yes,no,yes,"lac, na",,False

Patients were divided into two groups on the basis of the absence (Group I) or presence (Group II) of obstructive disease in a major coronary artery supplying myocardium remote from the prior myocardial infarction. There were 21 patients in Group I and 17 patients in Group II. They did not differ with respect to age, abnormalities of lipid or glucose metabolism, family history, history of hypertension or cigarette use, presence of obesity, or infarct localization. Ten of 17 patients in Group II had angina pectoris; only 3/21 patients in Group I had angina pectoris (p less than 0.01). All 12 patients tested in Group II had a positive maximal exercise tolerance test; only 1/17 patients tested in Group I was similarly positive (p less than 0.001). The absence of angina pectoris and the presence of a negative maximal exercise tolerance test is strong evidence against the pressure of significant CAD remote from that responsible for the prior myocardial infarction.","Adult, Angiocardiography, Cineangiography, Coronary Disease, Humans, Male, Myocardial Infarction, Prognosis",no,no,unk,yes,U,1266711.0, Clinical correlates of coronary cineangiography in young males with myocardial infarction ,no,no,yes,Unknown,,False

Statin-related events were documented for 18 778 (17.4%) patients. Of these, 11 124 had statins discontinued at least temporarily; 6579 were rechallenged with a statin over the subsequent 12 months. Most patients who were rechallenged (92.2%) were still taking a statin 12 months after the statin-related event. Among the 2721 patients who were rechallenged with the same statin to which they had a statin-related event, 1295 were receiving the same statin 12 months later, and 996 of them were receiving the same or a higher dose.Statin discontinuations and statin-related events were assessed in practices affiliated with 2 academic medical centers. Utilization of secondary data could have led to missing or misinterpreted data. Natural-language-processing tools used to compensate for the low (30%) proportion of reasons for statin discontinuation documented in structured electronic medical record fields are not perfectly accurate.Statin-related events are commonly reported and often lead to statin discontinuation. However, most patients who are rechallenged can tolerate statins long-term. This suggests that many of the statin-related events may have other causes, are tolerable, or may be specific to individual statins rather than the entire drug class.National Library of Medicine, Diabetes Action Research and Education Foundation, and Chinese National Key Program of Clinical Science.","Documentation, Electronic Health Records, Humans, Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors, Hypercholesterolemia, Natural Language Processing, Retrospective Studies, Withholding Treatment",no,no,unk,yes,U,23546564.0, Discontinuation of statins in routine care settings: a cohort study ,no,no,yes,Unknown,,False
36275039,Cardiometabolic risk factors and cardiovascular disease predictions in older African and European Americans,"Cardiometabolic (CMO) risks factors do not provide similar cardiovascular disease (CVD) predictions in young African (AA) and European Americans (EA) adults. Whether CMO risk predictions contribute to this disparity in older adults is unclear. We hypothesize that older AA CMO clustering pattern will be different from EA clustering patterns when determine with non-fasting lipid and lipoproteins. The participants were 106 older adults (66 AA and 40 EA) from a working/middle class neighborhood (income $46,364 - $80,904) in an urban North Carolina community. The participants were evaluated for CMO risk factors (total cholesterol, high- (HDL) and low-density lipoproteins (LDL), triglyceride (TG), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), systolic -SBP- and diastolic blood pressures -DBP), body mass index (BMI), body fat % (BF%) and timed up and go test (assessed falls risk and physical function). The AA participants were heavier, had higher BMI, BF%, and timed up and go values (pÂ <Â 0.01). The data were evaluated for differences (t-test) and Pearson correlations for relationships. If data differ by pÂ <Â 0.05 the data were significantly different. The AA had a 17.6Â % higher HDL (64.7 vs 55.1Â mg/dL - pÂ <Â 0.05) and 7.6Â % higher HbA1c (5.8 vs 5.4Â % - pÂ <Â 0.01) than EA. Higher HDL values in EA indicate lower CVD risks. The HDL paradox for AA (AA had higher HDL values, but greater CVD risks) was observed and the HbA1c difference may be misleading, as similar glucose values in AA tend to have higher HbA1c values. Lipid, lipoprotein, and blood pressure was not different between the races. AA had higher body composition and HDL values. Although future research on this topic with larger samples, dietary data and detailed descriptions of participations medications is warranted to validate findings from this study. These data suggest older AA and EA adults with similar environmental conditions have similar CMO risks when measures with none fasting blood samples. Since AA have a greater prevalence of CVD, these finding suggests that population specific CMO risk factor clustering may be more effective predictors of CVD for AA.Â© 2022 The Authors.",,no,no,unk,yes,U,36275039.0, Cardiometabolic risk factors and cardiovascular disease predictions in older African and European Americans ,no,no,yes,Unknown,,False
31434350,The Association between Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factors and 25-Hydroxivitamin D and Related Analytes among Hispanic/Latino Adults: A Pilot Study,"Although the association of vitamin D levels with cardiovascular risk profiles among Hispanics/Latinos has been studied, little is known about this association among Hispanics/Latinos with chronic conditions. This pilot study determined serum vitamin D and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels in a sample of participants from the University of Illinois at the Chicago Cohort of Patients, Family and Friends (UIC Cohort) and examined their association with traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors. From July 2012 to June 2016, the UIC Cohort study enrolled and conducted clinical examinations on men and women ages 18 years and older, who had one or more diagnosed chronic diseases/conditions (excluding cancer). This pilot study sample included 40 participants from the six main Hispanic/Latino background groups in the United States, namely Dominican, Cuban, Puerto Rican, Mexican, Central American, and South American, and were grouped by Caribbean or mainland origin. No substantial differences were noted in the vitamin D-related measures by Hispanic/Latino background, but the PTH levels were somewhat higher in the Caribbean vs. mainland group (43.0 Â± 4.6 vs. 38.6 Â± 2.7 pg/mL). The associations between selected CVD risk factors (systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP), total cholesterol, glucose) and PTH and vitamin D-related analytes were investigated using interval-censored multivariate regression models adjusted for age, sex, percent body fat, serum albumin/calcium, and Hispanic/Latino background. A negative association between total 25[OH]D and blood pressure was corroborated (SBP: Î² = -1.2, 95%CI = -2.0, -0.3; DBP: Î² = -0.7, 95% CI = -1.2, -0.1), whereas a positive association with total cholesterol was observed (Î² = 1.9, 95% CI = 0.02, 3.7). Levels of 1, 25[OH]2D were not associated with CVD risk factors, whereas 24, 25[OH]2D3 was associated with blood pressure (SBP: Î² = -13.0, 95% CI = -20.7, -5.2; DBP: Î² = -6.3, 95% CI = -11.6, -1.0). Estimated free 25[OH]D was inversely associated with both SBP (Î² = -3.5, 95% CI = -6.1, -0.9) and DBP (Î² = -2.1, 95% CI = -3.8, -0.3). Similarly, calculated bioavailable 25[OH]D was inversely associated with both SBP (Î² = -9.2, 95% CI = -15.9, -2.4) and DBP(Î² = -5.3, 95% CI = -9.8, -0.8). In conclusion, a negative association between 25[OH]D with BP was observed and a positive association with lipids is suggested. Due to the small sample size, most associations did not reach statistical significance.","Adult, Blood Pressure, Cardiovascular Diseases, Cohort Studies, Female, Hispanic or Latino, Humans, Lipids, Male, Middle Aged, Parathyroid Hormone, Pilot Projects, Risk Factors, United States, Vitamin D",no,no,unk,yes,U,31434350.0, The Association between Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factors and 25-Hydroxivitamin D and Related Analytes among Hispanic/Latino Adults: A Pilot Study ,no,no,yes,lac,,False
17329661,Prevalence of obesity and its metabolic correlates among the circumpolar inuit in 3 countries,"We investigated the prevalence of obesity and the metabolic correlates of different levels of body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference among the Inuit in 3 countries.Data from 4 surveys of Inuit in Canada, Greenland, and Alaska conducted during 1990-2001 were pooled, with a total sample size of 2545 participants. These data were compared with data from a Canadian population of predominantly European origin.Using the World Health Organization criteria for overweight and obesity, we found that the crude prevalence of overweight among Inuit men and women was 36.6% and 32.5%, respectively, and obesity was 15.8% and 25.5%, respectively. Inuit prevalences were similar to those of the highly developed countries of Europe and North America. As levels of obesity increased, as measured by BMI or waist circumference, the mean values of various metabolic indicators-lipid, glucose, and insulin levels and blood pressure-also increased. However, at each level of BMI or waist circumference, the Inuit had lower blood pressure and lipid levels than did Euro-Canadians.Our data indicate that universal criteria for obesity may not reflect the same degree of metabolic risk for populations such as the Inuit and suggest that ethnic-specific criteria are needed.","Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Alaska, Blood Pressure, Body Mass Index, Canada, Female, Greenland, Health Surveys, Humans, Inuit, Lipids, Male, Middle Aged, Obesity, Prevalence, Risk Assessment, White People",no,no,unk,yes,U,17329661.0, Prevalence of obesity and its metabolic correlates among the circumpolar inuit in 3 countries ,no,no,yes,Unknown,,False

PCOS is a common disorder in women of reproductive age and is associated with high rates of insulin resistance, glucose intolerance and dyslipidemia.A cross-sectional observational study was performed at an Academic Medical Center on 60 women of reproductive age with PCOS.Blood was obtained after fasting from 17 Hispanic, 22 non-Hispanic black and 21 non-Hispanic white women with PCOS who were similar in age and BMI. Anthropometric parameters, insulin, lipid and lipoprotein levels (measured by nuclear magnetic resonance) were compared between the three groups.Age and BMI did not differ between the groups. Hispanic women with PCOS had higher waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) (P = 0.02), homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (P = 0.03) and a more atherogenic lipid and lipoprotein profile consisting of lower high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (P = 0.02), higher low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particle number (P = 0.02), higher very low-density lipoprotein particle (VLDL) size (P = 0.03) and lower LDL (P = 0.03) and HDL particle size (P = 0.005) compared with non-Hispanic white women. The differences in HDL, HOMA-IR, VLDL and LDL size did not persist after adjustment for WHR while differences in LDL particle number (P = 0.04) and HDL size (P = 0.01) persisted.The sample size for the three groups was small but the findings were still significant. The women were mostly obese so the ethnic differences in metabolic disorders may not apply to non-obese women with PCOS.Independent of BMI, obese, reproductive age, Hispanic women with PCOS in the USA had a greater degree of abdominal obesity, insulin resistance and dyslipidemia. Hispanic women with PCOS may benefit from more focused management of metabolic parameters.This project was supported by the following National Institutes of Health grants: K23 DK080988-01A1 to S.S. and UL1RR029879 to CTSA at University of Illinois.

Methodology/principal findings: In the same French population analyzed in our previous GWA study (3,295 T2D and 3,595 NGT), strong associations with T2D were found for CDKAL1 (OR(rs7756992) = 1.30[1.19-1.42], P = 2.3x10(-9)), CDKN2A/2B (OR(rs10811661) = 0.74[0.66-0.82], P = 3.5x10(-8)) and more modestly for IGFBP2 (OR(rs1470579) = 1.17[1.07-1.27], P = 0.0003) SNPs. These results were replicated in both Israeli Ashkenazi (577 T2D and 552 NGT) and Austrian (504 T2D and 753 NGT) populations (except for CDKAL1) but not in the Moroccan population (521 T2D and 423 NGT). In the overall group of French subjects (4,232 T2D and 4,595 NGT), IGFBP2 and CXCR4 synergistically interacted with (LOC38776, SLC30A8, HHEX) and (NGN3, CDKN2A/2B), respectively, encoding for proteins presumably regulating pancreatic endocrine cell development and function. The T2D risk increased strongly when risk alleles, including the previously discovered T2D-associated TCF7L2 rs7903146 SNP, were combined (8.68-fold for the 14% of French individuals carrying 18 to 30 risk alleles with an allelic OR of 1.24). With an area under the ROC curve of 0.86, only 15 novel loci were necessary to discriminate French individuals susceptible to develop T2D._x000D_

Genes expressed in the pancreas interact together and their combined effect dramatically increases the risk for T2D, opening avenues for the development of genetic prediction tests.","Adult, Aged, Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 5, Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15, Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2, France, Genetic Markers, Genome, Human, Humans, Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 1, Middle Aged, Odds Ratio, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide, Predictive Value of Tests, tRNA Methyltransferases",yes,yes,we,yes,WE,18461161.0, Post genome-wide association studies of novel genes associated with type 2 diabetes show gene-gene interaction and high predictive value ,yes,yes,yes,cee,,False

7171325,Distribution of plasma lipids and glucose in two breeds of rabbit,"This study was undertaken to determine the frequency distribution of plasma lipid and glucose values in New Zealand White and Dutch-Belted rabbits. The results indicate that the levels of glucose, phospholipid and triglyceride were similar in the two breeds in contrast to cholesterol levels which were higher and more variable in the New Zealand White rabbit. These results are consistent with the higher incidence of spontaneous aortic lesions and more varied response to dietary cholesterol in the New Zealand White rabbit. Identification of rabbits having higher than normal fasting cholesterol levels may be valuable in the design of studies of within strain differences in cholesterol metabolism. The study also provides a useful baseline using current methods for glucose and lipid levels in the two breeds of rabbit.","Animals, Blood Glucose, Cholesterol, Lipids, Male, Phospholipids, Rabbits, Species Specificity, Triglycerides",no,no,Unknown,yes,WE,7171325.0, Distribution of plasma lipids and glucose in two breeds of rabbit ,no,no,yes,-,,False

9700668,Molecular regulation of the blood-brain barrier GLUT1 glucose transporter by brain-derived factors,"Glucose is the crucial metabolic fluid for the brain, and the transport of this nutrient from blood to brain is limited by the blood-brain barrier (BBB) GLUT1 glucose transporter. The activity of this transporter is altered in different pathophysiological conditions including Alzheimer's disease. The expression of the BBB-GLUT1 gene is directed by brain trophic factors, and the brain-derived peptide preparation Cerebrolysin (Cl, EBEWE, Austria), used in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, increases the BBB-GLUT1 mRNA stability and the expression of the BBB-GLUT1 gene. In the present investigation, Cl markedly increased (p < 0.001) the expression of a BBB-GLUT1 reporter gene, named clone 753, that contains an important regulatory cis-acting element involved in the stabilization of this transcript in brain endothelial cultured cells (ECL). In experiments with a reporter gene lacking this regulatory element, Cl produced only a minimal fraction of the effect observed with clone 753. UV-cross linking/PAGE experiments showed that the GLUT1 transcript reacts with ECL cytosolic proteins to form a RNA/protein complex of approximately 80 kDa. The abundance of this cis/trans acting complex was found to be increased in Cl-treated cells. Overall, data presented here demonstrate that i) Cl increases the expression of a BBB-GLUT1-luciferase reporter gene containing a region of the 3'-untranslated region of BBB-GLUT1 mRNA with important regulatory cis-acting elements involved in the stabilization of this transcript, and ii) the increased expression of this BBB-GLUT1 reporter gene was associated with augmented abundance of a transacting factor that binds to the cis-acting element described in (i), suggesting that this association may be involved in the stabilization of GLUT1 mRNA induced by Cl.","3' Untranslated Regions, Amino Acids, Animals, Blood-Brain Barrier, Brain Chemistry, Cattle, Gene Expression Regulation, Genes, Reporter, Glucose, Glucose Transporter Type 1, Monosaccharide Transport Proteins, Nootropic Agents, Rats, Transfection, Ultraviolet Rays",yes,no,unk,yes,WE,9700668.0, Molecular regulation of the blood-brain barrier GLUT1 glucose transporter by brain-derived factors ,no,no,yes,Unknown,,False

12148097,Prediction of renal insufficiency in Pima Indians with nephropathy of type 2 diabetes mellitus,"A high prevalence and early onset of type 2 diabetes in Pima Indians is well known. Our objective is to use several statistical models to identify predictors of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) deterioration and develop an algorithm to predict GFR 4 years after the initial evaluation.All records (n = 86) were randomly assigned to a training set (n = 60) and a testing set (n = 26). Linear regression, generalized additive, tree-based, and artificial neural network models were used to identify predictors of outcome and develop a prediction algorithm.Proteinuria remained the single most important predictor of long-term renal function; other predictors included baseline GFR, blood pressure, plasma renin activity, lipid profile, age, weight/body mass index, and diabetes duration. All four models achieved a good correlation (r = 0.73 to 0.78) between observed and predicted 4-year GFRs on a separate (testing) data set. Best results in predicting the value of GFR were achieved using a tree-based model with six terminal nodes (r = 0.78; root mean squared prediction error = 38.9). The tree-based and generalized additive models achieved high positive (91%) and negative (100%) predictive values in identifying subjects, who developed depressed GFRs in 4 years. An artificial neural network achieved the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.91).GFR depression within 4 years can be predicted with a precision that suggests potential clinical utility. A tree-based model with six terminal nodes has shown the best results in predicting the actual value of GFR, whereas an artificial neural network is the model of choice to identify the group of patients that will develop renal insufficiency.Copyright 2002 by the National Kidney Foundation, Inc.","Adult, Age Factors, Blood Pressure, Body Mass Index, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2, Diabetic Nephropathies, Female, Glomerular Filtration Rate, Humans, Indians, North American, Kidney Function Tests, Male, Models, Statistical, Predictive Value of Tests, Proteinuria, Renal Insufficiency, Renin, Risk Factors",no,no,unk,yes,SA,12148097.0, Prediction of renal insufficiency in Pima Indians with nephropathy of type 2 diabetes mellitus ,no,yes,yes,Unknown,,False

(Family: Rubiaceae) is widely used as a natural remedy for diabetes mellitus by the Nepali and Lepcha tribes of Sikkim and Darjeeling Himalayan region. The plant is administered to a diabetic individual in the form of leaf infusion for 2-3 weeks. Therefore, we investigated the effects of methanolic leaf extract of Paederia foetida (MEPF) on alloxan (ALX) induced diabetic renal oxidative stress and NF-kB dependent renoinflammatory events in rat. Method Effects of MEPF on blood glucose, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), serum and oxidative stress markers were evaluated in ALX induced diabetic wistar rats. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was carried out to estimate serum IL-6, IL-1Î², TNF-Î± and renal tissue NF-kB p65 levels. MEPF treatment was given to the diabetic rats at a dose of 250 and 500mg/kg body weight (b.w.).MEPF treatment significantly reduced hyperglycaemia, serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), triglycerides (TRIGs), and total cholesterol (TCHOL) levels in the diabetic rats, whereas it significantly restored GFR and serum albumin level. The activity of enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant machineries was remarkably augmented by MEPF treatment. Likewise, it also significantly lowered lipid peroxidation which was evidenced by decreased concentration of thiobarbituric reactive substances (malondialdehyde, MDA) in the renal tissue of treated diabetic groups. Moreover, MEPF treated animals exhibited low serum concentrations of IL-6, IL-1Î² and TNF-Î± compared to the diabetic control rats. It showed a dose dependent inhibition of NF-kB activation in the diabetic kidney, but the effects were more prominent at a dose of 500mg/kg. Histopathological examinations also confirmed its nephroprotective action during diabetes.MEPF treatment mitigates oxidative stress and suppresses renal inflammation via inhibition of NF-kB in diabetic kidney in early progressive diabetic nephropathy.Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Roxb leaf extract down-regulates expression of PPARÎ³2 and leptin genes in high fat diet fed C57BL/6J Mice and retards in vitro 3T3L1 pre-adipocyte differentiation,"Sida rhomboidea. Roxb leaf extract (SRLE) is being used by the populace of North-East India to alleviate symptoms of diabetes and obesity. We have previously reported its hypolipidemic and anti-diabetic properties. In this study, we report the effect of SRLE on (i) in vivo modulation of genes controlling high fat diet (HFD) induced obesity and (ii) in vitro 3T3L1 pre-adipocyte differentiation and leptin release. Supplementation with SRLE significantly prevented HFD induced increment in bodyweight, plasma lipids and leptin, visceral adiposity and adipocyte hypertrophy. Also, SRLE supplementation reduced food intake, down regulated PPARÎ³2, SREBP1c, FAS and LEP expressions and up-regulated CPT-1 in epididymal adipose tissue compared to obese mice. In vitro adipogenesis of 3T3L1 pre-adipocytes was significantly retarded in the presence of SRLE extract. Also decreased triglyceride accumulation, leptin release and glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate dehydrogenase activity along with higher glycerol release without significant alteration of viability of 3T3L1 pre-adipocytes, was recorded. Our findings suggest that prevention of HFD induced visceral adiposity is primarily by down regulation of PPARÎ³2 and leptin gene expression coupled with attenuation of food intake in C57BL/6J mice. SRLE induced prevention of pre-adipocytes differentiation, and leptin release further substantiated these findings and scientifically validates the potential application of SRLE as a therapeutic agent against obesity.","3T3-L1 Cells, Adipocytes, Animals, Anti-Obesity Agents, Cell Differentiation, Cell Survival, Diet, High-Fat, Down-Regulation, Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenases, Glycerol, Leptin, Male, Malvaceae, Mice, Mice, Inbred C57BL, PPAR gamma, Plant Extracts, Plant Leaves, Triglycerides",yes,yes,sa,yes,SA,21845103.0, Sida rhomboidea.

26216595,Proteomic-driven biomarker discovery in gestational diabetes mellitus: a review,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is defined as any degree of glucose intolerance with onset or first recognition during pregnancy and it affects 18% of pregnant women worldwide. GDM is considered a high-risk state which may lead to type II diabetes which is associated with an increase in a number of interrelated adverse perinatal outcomes. Given the fact that the progress of a successful pregnancy is dependent on the intricate communication between several biological molecules, identification of the proteomic profile perturbations in women with GDM is expected to help in understanding the disease pathogenesis and also discovery of clinical biomarker(s). In recent years, both gel-free and gel-based proteomics have been extensively investigated for improving maternal and child health. Although there are several reports integrating various aspects of proteomics in pregnancy related diseases such as preeclampsia, extensive Pubmed search shows no review so far on the application of proteomics in gestational diabetes. In this review, we focus on various high-throughput proteomic technologies for the identification of unique biosignatures and biomarkers responsible for the early prediction of GDM. Further, different analytical strategies and biological samples involved in proteomic analysis of this pregnancy-related disease are discussed.This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Proteomics in India.Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Genome-wide association studies identified several loci associated with diabetes but their impact on susceptibility to diabetic complications is unknown. We studied the association of 18 type 2 diabetes genome-wide association single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR; MDRD equation) and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio in 6958 Strong Heart Study family and cohort participants. Center-specific residuals of eGFR and log urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio, obtained from linear regression models adjusted for age, sex, and body mass index, were regressed onto SNP dosage using variance component models in family data and linear regression in unrelated individuals. Estimates were then combined across centers. Four diabetic loci were associated with eGFR and one locus with urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio. A SNP in the WFS1 gene (rs10010131) was associated with higher eGFR in younger individuals and with increased albuminuria. SNPs in the FTO, KCNJ11, and TCF7L2 genes were associated with lower eGFR, but not albuminuria, and were not significant in prospective analyses. Our findings suggest a shared genetic risk for type 2 diabetes and its kidney complications, and a potential role for WFS1 in early-onset diabetic nephropathy in American Indian populations.","Age of Onset, Aged, Albuminuria, Biomarkers, Creatinine, Cross-Sectional Studies, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2, Diabetic Nephropathies, Female, Gene Frequency, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, Genome-Wide Association Study, Glomerular Filtration Rate, Humans, Indians, North American, Kidney, Linear Models, Linkage Disequilibrium, Longitudinal Studies, Male, Membrane Proteins, Middle Aged, Phenotype, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide, Prospective Studies, Risk Assessment, Risk Factors, United States",yes,yes,unk,yes,SA,22513821.0, The association of genetic variants of type 2 diabetes with kidney function ,yes,yes,yes,Unknown,,False
34702783,Longitudinal Plasma Lipidome and Risk of Type 2 Diabetes in a Large Sample of American Indians With Normal Fasting Glucose: The Strong Heart Family Study,"Comprehensive assessment of alterations in lipid species preceding type 2 diabetes (T2D) is largely unknown. We aimed to identify plasma molecular lipids associated with risk of T2D in American Indians.Using untargeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, we repeatedly measured 3,907 fasting plasma samples from 1,958 participants who attended two examinations (âˆ¼5.5 years apart) and were followed up to 16 years in the Strong Heart Family Study. Mixed-effects logistic regression was used to identify lipids associated with risk of T2D, adjusting for traditional risk factors. Repeated measurement analysis was performed to examine the association between change in lipidome and change in continuous measures of T2D, adjusting for baseline lipids. Multiple testing was controlled by false discovery rate at 0.05.Higher baseline level of 33 lipid species, including triacylglycerols, diacylglycerols, phosphoethanolamines, and phosphocholines, was significantly associated with increased risk of T2D (odds ratio [OR] per SD increase in log2-transformed baseline lipids 1.50-2.85) at 5-year follow-up. Of these, 21 lipids were also associated with risk of T2D at 16-year follow-up. Aberrant lipid profiles were also observed in prediabetes (OR per SD increase in log2-transformed baseline lipids 1.30-2.19 for risk lipids and 0.70-0.78 for protective lipids). Longitudinal changes in 568 lipids were significantly associated with changes in continuous measures of T2D. Multivariate analysis identified distinct lipidomic signatures differentiating high- from low-risk groups.Lipid dysregulation occurs many years preceding T2D, and novel molecular lipids (both baseline level and longitudinal change over time) are significantly associated with risk of T2D beyond traditional risk factors. Our findings shed light on the mechanisms linking dyslipidemia to T2D and may yield novel therapeutic targets for early intervention tailored to American Indians.Â© 2021 by the American Diabetes Association.",,no,yes,unk,yes,SA,34702783.0, Longitudinal Plasma Lipidome and Risk of Type 2 Diabetes in a Large Sample of American Indians With Normal Fasting Glucose: The Strong Heart Family Study ,yes,yes,yes,Unknown,,False
33889958,Association of Genetic Variants for Plasma LRG1 With Rapid Decline in Kidney Function in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes,"Elevated levels of plasma leucine-rich Î±-2-glycoprotein 1 (LRG1), a component of transforming growth factor beta signaling, are associated with development and progression of chronic kidney disease in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, whether this relationship is causal is uncertain.To identify genetic variants associated with plasma LRG1 levels and determine whether genetically predicted plasma LRG1 contributes to a rapid decline in kidney function (RDKF) in patients with T2D.We performed a genome-wide association study of plasma LRG1 among 3694 T2D individuals [1881 (983 Chinese, 420 Malay, and 478 Indian) discovery from Singapore Study of Macro-angiopathy and Micro-vascular Reactivity in Type 2 Diabetes cohort and 1813 (Chinese) validation from Diabetic Nephropathy cohort]. One- sample Mendelian randomization analysis was performed among 1337 T2D Chinese participants with preserved glomerular filtration function [baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) â‰¥60 mL/min/1.73 m2)].

Mendelian randomization analysis provided evidence for a potential causal effect of plasma LRG1 on kidney function decline in T2D (Pâ€…<â€…0.05).We demonstrate that genetically influenced plasma LRG1 increases the risk of RDKF in T2D patients, suggesting plasma LRG1 as a potential treatment target.

We assessed the replication of the seven lead single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and evaluated these loci for additional signals in American Indians.Seven SNPs were genotyped in 7,710 individuals from a longitudinally studied American Indian population, and associations with type 2 diabetes, BMI and related phenotypes were assessed. Previous genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from these individuals were used to screen for additional type 2 diabetes signals at these loci. A variant independent of the trans-ancestry meta-analysis was identified within LPP, and its replication was assessed in an additional 3,106 urban American Indians.SNP rs6813195 near to TMEM154 was nominally associated with type 2 diabetes (pâ€‰=â€‰0.01, OR 1.12 [95% CI 1.03, 1.22]) and adiposity: the type 2 diabetes risk allele was associated with a lower percentage body fat (Î²â€‰=â€‰-1.451%, pâ€‰=â€‰4.8â€‰Ã—â€‰10(-4)). Another SNP, rs3130501 near to POU5F1-TCF19, was associated with BMI (Î²â€‰=â€‰-0.012, pâ€‰=â€‰0.004), type 2 diabetes adjusted for BMI (pâ€‰=â€‰0.02, OR 1.11 [95% CI 1.02, 1.22]), 2Â h glucose concentrations (Î²â€‰=â€‰0.080Â mmol/l, pâ€‰=â€‰0.02) and insulin resistance estimated by homeostatic model (Î²â€‰=â€‰0.039, pâ€‰=â€‰0.009). The independent variant identified at the LPP locus in our American Indian GWAS for type 2 diabetes was replicated in the additional samples (all American Indian meta-analysis, pâ€‰=â€‰8.9â€‰Ã—â€‰10(-6), OR 1.29 [95% CI 1.15, 1.45]).For two of the seven newly identified variants, there was nominal evidence for association with type 2 diabetes and related traits in American Indians. Identification of an independent variant at the LPP locus suggests the existence of more than one type 2 diabetes signal at this locus.","Adult, Cytoskeletal Proteins, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2, Female, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, Genome-Wide Association Study, Genotype, Humans, Indians, North American, LIM Domain Proteins, Male, Middle Aged, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide, Young Adult",yes,yes,unk,yes,SA,25112377.0, Variants associated with type 2 diabetes identified by the transethnic meta-analysis study: assessment in American Indians and evidence for a new signal in LPP ,yes,yes,yes,Unknown,,False
24728127,Common genetic variation in the glucokinase gene (GCK) is associated with type 2 diabetes and rates of carbohydrate oxidation and energy expenditure,"Glucokinase (GCK) plays a role in glucose metabolism and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Rare mutations in GCK cause MODY. We investigated whether common variation (minor allele frequency â‰¥0.01) in GCK is associated with metabolic traits and type 2 diabetes.Four exonic single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and three SNPs predicted to cause loss of promoter function were identified in whole-genome sequence data from 234 Pima Indians. These seven tag SNPs and rs4607517, a type 2 diabetes variant established in other studies, were analysed in 415 full-heritage non-diabetic Pima Indians characterised for metabolic traits, and 7,667 American Indians who had data on type 2 diabetes and BMI.A novel 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) SNP, chr7:44184184-G/A, was associated with the rate of carbohydrate oxidation post-absorptively (Î²â€‰=â€‰0.22 mg [kg estimated metabolic body size (EMBS)](-1)â€‰min(-1), pâ€‰=â€‰0.005) and during a hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp (Î²â€‰=â€‰0.24 mg [kg EMBS](-1)â€‰min(-1), pâ€‰=â€‰0.0002), the rate of carbohydrate oxidation in a respiratory chamber (Î²â€‰=â€‰311 kJ/day, pâ€‰=â€‰0.03) and 24 h energy expenditure, which was attributable to the thermic effect of food (Î²â€‰=â€‰520 kJ/day, pâ€‰=â€‰3.39â€‰Ã—â€‰10(-6)). This 3'UTR SNP was also associated with diabetes (OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.11, 1.65, pâ€‰=â€‰0.002), where the A allele (allele frequency 0.05) was associated with a lower rate of carbohydrate oxidation, lower 24 h energy expenditure and higher risk for diabetes. In a Cox proportional hazards model, a rate of insulin-stimulated carbohydrate oxidation lower than the mean rate at baseline predicted a higher risk for developing diabetes than for those above the mean (hazard rate ratio 2.2, 95% CI 1.3, 3.6, pâ€‰=â€‰0.002).Common variation in GCK influences the rate of carbohydrate oxidation, 24 h energy expenditure and diabetes risk in Pima Indians.","Adult, Alleles, Carbohydrate Metabolism, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2, Energy Metabolism, Female, Gene Frequency, Genetic Association Studies, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, Glucokinase, Humans, Indians, North American, Male, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide, Young Adult",yes,yes,unk,yes,SA,24728127.0, Common genetic variation in the glucokinase gene (GCK) is associated with type 2 diabetes and rates of carbohydrate oxidation and energy expenditure ,yes,yes,yes,Unknown,,False
24582139,Potential epigenetic dysregulation of genes associated with MODY and type 2 diabetes in humans exposed to a diabetic intrauterine environment: an analysis of genome-wide DNA methylation,"The aim of this study is to investigate the potential role of DNA methylation in mediating the increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes in offspring of mothers who had diabetes during pregnancy.Peripheral blood leukocytes were collected from non-diabetic Pima Indians who were either offspring of diabetic mothers (ODM; n=14) or offspring of nondiabetic mothers (ONDM; n=14). The two groups were matched for age, sex, age of mother, and fraction of Pima ethnicity. Differentially methylated regions were determined using a MeDIP-chip assay on an Affymetrix Human Tiling 2.0R Array. Data were analyzed using the model based analysis of tiling arrays (MAT) algorithm, and 4883 regions overlapping with putative promoters, were identified as differentially methylated, having met an empirically derived threshold (nominal p<0.0077). The list of genes with differentially methylated promoters was subjected to KEGG pathway analysis to determine canonical metabolic pathways enriched by these genes.Pathway analysis of genes with differentially methylated promoters identified the top 3 enriched pathways as maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY), type 2 diabetes, and Notch signaling. Several genes in these pathways are known to affect pancreatic development and insulin secretion.These findings support the hypothesis that epigenetic changes may increase the risk of type 2 diabetes via an effect on Î²-cell function in the offspring of mothers with diabetes during pregnancy.Published by Elsevier Inc.","Adolescent, Adult, Child, DNA Methylation, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2, Epigenesis, Genetic, Female, Gene Expression Profiling, Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental, Gene-Environment Interaction, Genome, Human, Humans, Longitudinal Studies, Male, Pregnancy, Pregnancy in Diabetics, Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects, Uterus, Young Adult",yes,yes,unk,yes,SA,24582139.0, Potential epigenetic dysregulation of genes associated with MODY and type 2 diabetes in humans exposed to a diabetic intrauterine environment: an analysis of genome-wide DNA methylation ,yes,yes,yes,Unknown,,False
17287471,"Variants in ARHGEF11, a candidate gene for the linkage to type 2 diabetes on chromosome 1q, are nominally associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes in Pima Indians","A prior genome-wide linkage scan in Pima Indians indicated a young-onset (aged <45 years) type 2 diabetes susceptibility locus on chromosome 1q21-q23. ARHGEF11, which encodes the Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 11, was analyzed as a positional candidate gene for this linkage because this protein may stimulate Rho-dependent signals, such as the insulin signaling cascade. The ARHGEF11 gene, and two adjacent genes NTRK1 and INSRR, were sequenced in 24 Pima Indians who were not first-degree relatives. Sequencing of the coding regions, 5' and 3' untranslated regions and putative promoter regions of these genes, identified 28 variants in ARHGEF11, 11 variants in NTRK1, and 8 variants in INSSR. These 47 variants, as well as 84 additional public database variants within/between these genes, were genotyped for association analysis in the same group of Pima Indians who had participated in the linkage study (n = 1,228). An R1467H in ARHGEF11, and several additional noncoding variants that were in high linkage disequilibrium with this variant, were nominally associated with young-onset type 2 diabetes (P = 0.01; odds ratio 3.39) after adjusting for sex, family membership, and Pima heritage. The risk allele H had a frequency of 0.10. In a subgroup of 262 nondiabetic, full-heritage Pima Indians who had undergone detailed metabolic testing, the risk allele H also was associated with a lower mean insulin-mediated glucose disposal rate and a lower mean nonoxidative glucose storage rate after adjusting for age, sex, nuclear family membership, and percentage of body fat (P < or = 0.01). These findings suggest that variation within ARHGEF11 nominally increases risk of type 2 diabetes, possibly as a result of increased insulin resistance.","Adult, Arizona, Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2, Female, Genetic Linkage, Genetic Variation, Genome, Human, Genotype, Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors, Humans, Indians, North American, Insulin Resistance, Male, Middle Aged, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide, Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors",yes,yes,unk,yes,SA,17287471.0," Variants in ARHGEF11, a candidate gene for the linkage to type 2 diabetes on chromosome 1q, are nominally associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes in Pima Indians ",yes,yes,yes,Unknown,,False
17846125,A search for variants associated with young-onset type 2 diabetes in American Indians in a 100K genotyping array,"To identify genetic variants in linkage disequilibrium with those conferring diabetes susceptibility, a genome-wide association study for young-onset diabetes was conducted in an American-Indian population.Data come from 300 case subjects with type 2 diabetes with age of onset <25 years and 334 nondiabetic control subjects aged >or=45 years. To provide for tests of within-family association, 121 nondiabetic siblings of case subjects were included along with 140 diabetic siblings of control subjects (172 sibships). Individuals were genotyped on the Affymetrix 100K array, resulting in 80,044 usable single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). SNPs were analyzed for within-family association and for general association in case and control subjects, and these tests were combined by Fisher's method, with priority given to the within-family test.There were more SNPs with low P values than expected theoretically under the global null hypothesis of no association, and 128 SNPs had evidence for association at P < 0.001. The association of these SNPs with diabetes was further investigated in 1,207 diabetic and 1,627 nondiabetic individuals from the population study who were not included in the genome-wide study. SNPs from 10 genomic regions showed evidence for replication at P < 0.05. These included SNPs on chromosome 3 near ZNF659, chromosome 11 near FANCF, chromosome 11 near ZBTB15, and chromosome 12 near SENP1.These studies suggest several regions where marker alleles are potentially in linkage disequilibrium with variants that confer susceptibility to young-onset type 2 diabetes in American Indians.","Adolescent, Adult, Age of Onset, Arizona, Child, Child, Preschool, DNA, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2, Female, Genetic Variation, Genotype, Glucose Tolerance Test, Humans, Indians, North American, Linkage Disequilibrium, Male, Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis, Siblings",yes,yes,unk,yes,SA,17846125.0, A search for variants associated with young-onset type 2 diabetes in American Indians in a 100K genotyping array ,yes,yes,yes,Unknown,,False

The objective of this study was to identify coding variation that increases risk for T2D via an effect on a pre-diabetic trait.Whole exome sequencing was done in 177 Pima Indians. Selected variants (N = 345) were genotyped in 555 subjects characterized for body fatness, glucose disposal rates during a clamp, acute insulin response to glucose, and 2-h plasma glucose concentrations during an OGTT, and were also genotyped in up to 5,880 subjects with longitudinal measures of BMI.

MODY can result from heterozygous mutations in at least five genes. The purpose of this study was to determine whether alterations in known MODY genes and two MODY candidate genes contribute to the development of early-onset type 2 diabetes in Pima Indians.The coding regions of the known MODY genes hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-1alpha, HNF-4alpha, HNF-1beta, and insulin promoter factor 1 and the coding regions of two MODY candidate genes, HNF-3beta and the dimerization cofactor of HNF-1, were sequenced in genomic DNA from Pima Indians.

Deconstructing diabetic nephropathy into intermediate, quantitative phenotypes may increase feasibility of detecting susceptibility loci by genetic screens. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which characterizes diabetic nephropathy, was employed as a quantitative trait in a preliminary whole-genome scan.Estimated GFR (eGFR) was calculated for 882 diabetic sibpairs (mean age 57 years) of African-American (25.6% of total), American Indian (8.6%), European-American (14.2%), and Mexican-American (51.6%) descent enrolled in the initial phase of the Family Investigation of Nephropathy and Diabetes (FIND). A whole-genome scan was performed using 404 microsatellite markers (average spacing 9 cM) and model-free linkage analysis.For all ethnicities combined, strong evidence for linkage was observed on chromosomes 1q43 (P = 3.6 x 10(-3)), 7q36.1 (P = 2.1 x 10(-4)), 8q13.3 (P = 4.6 x 10(-4)), and 18q23.3 (P = 2.7 x 10(-3)).

Genetic variants in or near ASK1 were analyzed to assess the role of this gene in insulin action and type 2 diabetes.Genotypic data from 31 variants were used to determine the linkage disequilibrium pattern across ASK1 in Pima Indians. Eight tag SNPs were initially genotyped in 3,501 full-heritage Pima Indians. Replication for association with diabetes was assessed in a second population-based sample of 3,723 Native Americans and the published DIAGRAM study. Quantitative traits were analyzed in 536 nondiabetic Native Americans, and ASK1 expression was examined in skeletal muscle of 153 nondiabetic Native Americans.Three tag SNPs were associated with type 2 diabetes (rs35898099, P = 0.003, odds ratio [95% CI] 1.27 [1.08-1.47]; rs1570056, P = 0.007, 1.19 [1.05-1.36]; rs7775356, P = 0.04, 1.14 [1.01-1.28]) in the full-heritage Pima Indians.

Pima Indians have a low incidence of cardiovascular disease despite having a high prevalence of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) which in this population is not associated with elevated plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 activity. In Caucasians an insertion/deletion (4G/5G) polymorphism in the promoter region of the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 gene that has been related to activity levels of its protein in plasma differentially binds repressor and enhancer elements. In 265 Pima Indians (133 diabetic, 132 non-diabetic, 129 male, 136 female, male, mean age 46.6, range 34-68 years) the promoter genotype frequencies were 23.0% for 4G/4G, 49.8% for 4G/5G and 27.2% for 5G/5G compared to 35.4%, 50.8% and 13.8% respectively, (chi 2 = 15.3, 2 df, p < 0.0005) previously reported in Caucasians with NIDDM. The mean plasma activity levels in the three genotypes in the Pima Indians were 18.2, 19.1 and 18.1 U/ml, respectively.

Here we tested cytosine methylation levels at 397,063 genomic CpG sites for association with decline in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) over a six year period in 181 diabetic Pima Indians. Methylation levels at 77 sites showed significant association with eGFR decline after correction for multiple comparisons. A model including methylation level at two probes (cg25799291 and cg22253401) improved prediction of eGFR decline in addition to baseline eGFR and the albumin to creatinine ratio with the percent of variance explained significantly improving from 23.1% to 42.2%. Cg22253401 was also significantly associated with eGFR decline in a case-control study derived from the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort. Probes at which methylation significantly associated with eGFR decline were localized to gene regulatory regions and enriched for genes with metabolic functions and apoptosis. Three of the 77 probes that were associated with eGFR decline in blood samples showed directionally consistent and significant association with fibrosis in microdissected human kidney tissue, after correction for multiple comparisons.

The in vivo experiments with aqueous JSE showed significant protective effects against chromosomal damage induced by the genotoxic carcinogens URE and DMBA. Biochemical assays registered significant inhibition of hepatic lipid peroxidation and increase in GSH level and activity of GST, SOD and CAT.Our findings suggest that JSE can possibly play an important role as a chemopreventive agent against oxidative stress and genomic damage.Copyright Â© 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The AI/AN population has a high prevalence of DM in adults aged 20 years or older and is developing DM at a younger age than the general U.S.DM is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), and mortality from CVD is higher in AI/ANs than the general population, as is the prevalence of stroke and 1-year poststroke mortality for both genders when compared to non-Hispanic whites. A genome-wide scan found a number of chromosome linkages in the AI/AN population that suggest that genetic factors may contribute to their high risk of DM and CVD. Importantly, studies also suggest that in addition to race/ethnicity, cultural norms and historic conditions play important roles in the prevalence of DM and CVD in this population. Therefore, multiple factors should be taken into consideration when establishing prevention programs to decrease the prevalence of obesity, diabetes, and CVD incidence among adults and children in the AI/AN population. Prevention programs should focus on behavioral risk factors and lifestyle changes like encouraging smoking cessation, healthy diet, and increased physical activity while taking into consideration cultural, economic, and geographic factors.","Cardiovascular Diseases, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2, Humans, Incidence, Indians, North American, Prevalence, Risk, Risk Assessment, Smoking, United States",no,yes,unk,no,SA,30302343.0, Diabetes and Associated Cardiovascular Complications in American Indians/Alaskan Natives: A Review of Risks and Prevention Strategies ,no,yes,no,Unknown,,False
35563754,Generation of Isogenic hiPSCs with Targeted Edits at Multiple Intronic SNPs to Study the Effects of the Type 2 Diabetes Associated KCNQ1 Locus in American Indians,"The top genetic association signal for type 2 diabetes (T2D) in Southwestern American Indians maps to intron 15 of KCNQ1, an imprinted gene. We aim to understand the biology whereby variation at this locus affects T2D specifically in this genomic background. To do so, we obtained human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) derived from American Indians. Using these iPSCs, we show that imprinting of KCNQ1 and CDKN1C during pancreatic islet-like cell generation from iPSCs is consistent with known imprinting patterns in fetal pancreas and adult islets and therefore is an ideal model system to study this locus. In this report, we detail the use of allele-specific guide RNAs and CRISPR to generate isogenic hiPSCs that differ only at multiple T2D associated intronic SNPs at this locus which can be used to elucidate their functional effects. Characterization of these isogenic hiPSCs identified a few aberrant cell lines; namely cell lines with large hemizygous deletions in the putative functional region of KCNQ1 and cell lines hypomethylated at the KCNQ1OT1 promoter. Comparison of an isogenic cell line with a hemizygous deletion to the parental cell line identified CDKN1C and H19 as differentially expressed during the endocrine progenitor stage of pancreatic-islet development.","Adult, American Indian or Alaska Native, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2, Genomic Imprinting, Humans, Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells, KCNQ1 Potassium Channel, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",yes,yes,unk,yes,SA,35563754.0, Generation of Isogenic hiPSCs with Targeted Edits at Multiple Intronic SNPs to Study the Effects of the Type 2 Diabetes Associated KCNQ1 Locus in American Indians ,yes,yes,yes,Unknown,,False
11243729,"Subcutaneous abdominal adipocyte size, a predictor of type 2 diabetes, is linked to chromosome 1q21--q23 and is associated with a common polymorphism in LMNA in Pima Indians","Large subcutaneous abdominal adipocyte size (s.c. abd. AS) is associated with insulin resistance and predicts type 2 diabetes in Pima Indians. Because type 2 diabetes is familial, we aimed to determine whether mean s.c. abd. AS is also familial and if so, to identify chromosomal regions linked to this measure. Body composition (hydrodensitometry) and mean s.c. abd. AS (fat biopsy) were measured in 295 Pima Indians (179 with normal, 80 with impaired, and 36 with diabetic glucose tolerance) representing 164 nuclear families. Mean s.c. abd. AS, adjusted for age, sex, and percentage body fat was a familial trait (heritability h(2) = 0.48, P < 0.0001). A genome-wide autosomal scan revealed suggestive evidence for linkage (LOD 1.73) of adjusted mean s.c. abd. AS to chromosome 1q21--q23, a region containing LMNA, the gene encoding for the nuclear envelope proteins lamin A/C. Rare mutations in LMNA were recently shown to underlie familial partial lipodystrophy (FPLD), a syndrome characterized by regional loss of adipose tissue, insulin resistance, and glucose intolerance. A common (allelic frequency 0.43) single nucleotide polymorphism (silent 1908C --> T substitution) in exon 10 of LMNA (GenBank X03444) was associated with reduced age-, sex- and percentage body fat-adjusted mean s.c. abd. AS [0.80 +/- 0.17 (CC), 0.76 +/- 0.15 (CT), 0.73 +/- 0.16 (TT) microg lipid/cell, P < 0.05 for CC vs TT]. These findings indicate that approximately half of the variance in mean s.c. abd.

11723070,Genome-wide linkage analysis assessing parent-of-origin effects in the inheritance of type 2 diabetes and BMI in Pima Indians,"We examined the hypothesis that imprinted genes may affect the propensity to type 2 diabetes and obesity in Pima Indians. Multipoint variance component methods were used to assess linkage of BMI (kg/m(2)) and age-adjusted diabetes to loci derived from either father (LOD(FA)) or mother (LOD(MO)) in a genome-wide scan. Tentative evidence of loci where imprinted genes might be acting was found for diabetes with maternally derived alleles on chromosomes 5 (LOD(MO) = 1.5) and 14 (LOD(MO) = 1.6). Evidence of linkage of BMI to maternally derived alleles was found on chromosome 5 (LOD(MO) = 1.7) and to paternally derived alleles on chromosome 10p (LOD(FA) = 1.7). Additional analyses of sibling pairs who were affected by diabetes and younger than 25 years of age showed an increase of sharing of maternally derived alleles on chromosome 6 (LOD(MO) = 3.0). We also examined sites of a priori interest where action of imprinted genes has been proposed in diabetes or obesity. We found no evidence of parent-specific linkage (of either diabetes or BMI) on chromosome 11p, a region that contains several imprinted genes, but observed weak evidence of linkage of diabetes to paternally derived alleles (LOD(FA) = 0.9) in the region of chromosome 6q, believed to contain an exclusively paternally expressed gene or genes that cause transient neonatal diabetes mellitus. In conclusion, we determined regions of interest on chromosomes 5, 6, and 10 where imprinted genes might be affecting the risk of type 2 diabetes or obesity in Pima Indians.","Aging, Alleles, Body Mass Index, Chromosomes, Human, Pair 10, Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14, Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5, Chromosomes, Human, Pair 6, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2, Female, Genetic Linkage, Genomic Imprinting, Humans, Indians, North American, Lod Score, Male, Nuclear Family",yes,yes,unk,yes,SA,11723070.0, Genome-wide linkage analysis assessing parent-of-origin effects in the inheritance of type 2 diabetes and BMI in Pima Indians ,yes,yes,yes,Unknown,,False
17846126,Identification of novel candidate genes for type 2 diabetes from a genome-wide association scan in the Old Order Amish: evidence for replication from diabetes-related quantitative traits and from independent populations,"We sought to identify type 2 diabetes susceptibility genes through a genome-wide association scan (GWAS) in the Amish.DNA from 124 type 2 diabetic case subjects and 295 control subjects with normal glucose tolerance were genotyped on the Affymetrix 100K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array. A total of 82,485 SNPs were tested for association with type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes-associated SNPs were further prioritized by the following: 1) associations with 5 oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) traits in 427 nondiabetic Amish subjects, and 2) in silico replication from three independent 100L SNP GWASs (Framingham Heart Study Caucasians, Pima Indians, and Mexican Americans) and a 500K GWAS in Scandinavians.The strongest association (P = 1.07 x 10(-5)) was for rs2237457, which is located in growth factor receptor-bound protein 10 (Grb10), an adaptor protein that regulate insulin receptor signaling. rs2237457 was also strongly associated with OGTT glucose area under the curve in nondiabetic subjects (P = 0.001). Of the 1,093 SNPs associated with type 2 diabetes at P < 0.01, 67 SNPs demonstrated associations with at least one OGTT trait in nondiabetic individuals; 80 SNPs were nominally associated with type 2 diabetes in one of the three independent 100K GWASs, 3 SNPs (rs2540317 in MFSD9, rs10515353 on chromosome 5, and rs2242400 in BCAT1 were associated with type 2 diabetes in more than one population), and 11 SNPs were nominally associated with type 2 diabetes in Scandinavians. One type 2 diabetes-associated SNP (rs3845971, located in FHIT) showed replication with OGTT traits and also in another population.Our GWAS of type 2 diabetes identified several gene variants associated with type 2 diabetes, some of which are worthy of further study.","Adult, Aged, Body Mass Index, Chromosome Mapping, DNA, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2, Ethnicity, Female, GRB10 Adaptor Protein, Genome, Human, Humans, Male, Maryland, Middle Aged, Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis, Overweight, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide, Quantitative Trait Loci",yes,yes,unk,yes,SA,17846126.0, Identification of novel candidate genes for type 2 diabetes from a genome-wide association scan in the Old Order Amish: evidence for replication from diabetes-related quantitative traits and from independent populations ,yes,yes,yes,Unknown,,False

PEA15 is located within a region on human 1q linked with type 2 diabetes in both Pima Indians and Caucasians. To assess the potential contribution of genetic alterations within this locus to disease susceptibility in the Pimas, we have investigated its genomic sequences. The PEA15 locus is composed of four exons spanning approximately 10.2kb of genomic DNA, flanked upstream by an potentially expressed Alu element, downstream by the H326 gene, and is located within 250kb of KCNJ9. We also sequenced over 2kb of the promoter region and identified various motifs analogous to known transcription factor binding sites. By analysis of 22 Pimas, including 13 diabetic subjects, we detected four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the non-coding regions of PEA15, including three frequent variants that were in allelic disequilibrium, and one variant found only in a single Pima. The three SNPs were not associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus in 50 affected and 50 control Pimas (p=0.12-0.17), and we conclude that mutations in this gene probably do not contribute significantly to disease susceptibility in this Native American tribe. However, knowledge of the genomic structure of PEA15 provides the basis for similar systematic examinations of this candidate locus in relation to type 2 diabetes and other metabolic disorders in other populations.","Alleles, Alu Elements, Asian People, Base Sequence, Chromosomes, Artificial, Yeast, Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2, Exons, Genetic Linkage, Genotype, Humans, Indians, North American, Introns, Models, Genetic, Molecular Sequence Data, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide, Promoter Regions, Genetic, Protein Kinase C",yes,yes,unk,yes,SA,10607908.0, Molecular characterization of the human PEA15 gene on 1q21-q22 and association with type 2 diabetes mellitus in Pima Indians ,yes,yes,yes,Unknown,,False
23630301,Strong parent-of-origin effects in the association of KCNQ1 variants with type 2 diabetes in American Indians,"Parent-of-origin effects were observed in an Icelandic population for several genetic variants associated with type 2 diabetes, including those in KLF14 (rs4731702), MOB2 (rs2334499), and KCNQ1 (rs2237892, rs231362). We analyzed parent-of-origin effects for these variants, along with two others in KCNQ1 identified in previous genome-wide association studies (rs2237895, rs2299620), in 7,351 Pima Indians from 4,549 nuclear families; 34% of participants had diabetes. In a subset of 287 normoglycemic individuals, acute insulin secretion was measured by an intravenous glucose tolerance test. Statistically significant (P < 0.05) parent-of-origin effects were seen for association with type 2 diabetes for all variants. The strongest effect was seen at rs2299620 in KCNQ1; the C allele was associated with increased diabetes when maternally derived (odds ratio [OR], 1.92; P = 4.1 Ã— 10(-12)), but not when paternally derived (OR, 0.93; P = 0.47; P = 9.9 Ã— 10(-6) for difference in maternal and paternal effects). A maternally derived C allele also was associated with a 28% decrease in insulin secretion (P = 0.002). This study confirms parent-of-origin effects in the association with type 2 diabetes for variants in KLF14, MOB2, and KCNQ1. In Pima Indians, the effect of maternally derived KCNQ1 variants appears to be mediated through decreased insulin secretion and is particularly strong, accounting for 4% of the variance in liability to diabetes.","Adult, Alleles, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2, Female, Genetic Association Studies, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, Genotype, Glucose Tolerance Test, Haplotypes, Humans, Indians, North American, Insulin, Insulin Secretion, KCNQ1 Potassium Channel, Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors, Longitudinal Studies, Male, Nerve Tissue Proteins, Parents, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide, Sp Transcription Factors",yes,yes,unk,yes,SA,23630301.0, Strong parent-of-origin effects in the association of KCNQ1 variants with type 2 diabetes in American Indians ,yes,yes,yes,Unknown,,False
28127622,Differential methylation of genes in individuals exposed to maternal diabetes in utero,"Individuals exposed to maternal diabetes in utero are more likely to develop metabolic and cardiovascular diseases later in life. This may be partially attributable to epigenetic regulation of gene expression. We performed an epigenome-wide association study to examine whether differential DNA methylation, a major source of epigenetic regulation, can be observed in offspring of mothers with type 2 diabetes during the pregnancy (OMD) compared with offspring of mothers with no diabetes during the pregnancy (OMND).DNA methylation was measured in peripheral blood using the Illumina HumanMethylation450K BeadChip. A total of 423,311 CpG sites were analysed in 388 Pima Indian individuals, mean age at examination was 13.0Â years, 187 of whom were OMD and 201 were OMND. Differences in methylation between OMD and OMND were assessed.Forty-eight differentially methylated CpG sites (with an empirical false discovery rate â‰¤0.05), mapping to 29 genes and ten intergenic regions, were identified. The gene with the strongest evidence was LHX3, in which six CpG sites were hypermethylated in OMD compared with OMND (pâ€‰â‰¤â€‰1.1â€‰Ã—â€‰10-5). Similarly, a CpG near PRDM16 was hypermethylated in OMD (1.1% higher, pâ€‰=â€‰5.6â€‰Ã—â€‰10-7), where hypermethylation also predicted future diabetes risk (HR 2.12 per SD methylation increase, pâ€‰=â€‰9.7â€‰Ã—â€‰10-5). Hypermethylation near AK3 and hypomethylation at PCDHGA4 and STC1 were associated with exposure to diabetes in utero (AK3: 2.5% higher, pâ€‰=â€‰7.8â€‰Ã—â€‰10-6; PCDHGA4: 2.8% lower, pâ€‰=â€‰3.0â€‰Ã—â€‰10-5; STC1: 2.9% lower, pâ€‰=â€‰1.6â€‰Ã—â€‰10-5) and decreased insulin secretory function among offspring with normal glucose tolerance (AK3: 0.088 SD lower per SD of methylation increase, pâ€‰=â€‰0.02; PCDHGA4: 0.08 lower SD per SD of methylation decrease, pâ€‰=â€‰0.03; STC1: 0.072 SD lower per SD of methylation decrease, pâ€‰=â€‰0.05).

9541507,An autosomal genomic scan for loci linked to prediabetic phenotypes in Pima Indians,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a common chronic disease that is thought to have a substantial genetic basis. Identification of the genes responsible has been hampered by the complex nature of the syndrome. Abnormalities in insulin secretion and insulin action predict the development of type 2 diabetes and are, themselves, highly heritable traits. Since fewer genes may contribute to these precursors of type 2 diabetes than to the overall syndrome, such genes may be easier to identify. We, therefore, undertook an autosomal genomic scan to identify loci linked to prediabetic traits in Pima Indians, a population with a high prevalence of type 2 diabetes. 363 nondiabetic Pima Indians were genotyped at 516 polymorphic microsatellite markers on all 22 autosomes. Linkage analyses were performed using three methods (single-marker, nonparametric multipoint [MAPMAKER/SIBS], and variance components multipoint). These analyses provided evidence for linkage at several chromosomal regions, including 3q21-24 linked to fasting plasma insulin concentration and in vivo insulin action, 4p15-q12 linked to fasting plasma insulin concentration, 9q21 linked to 2-h insulin concentration during oral glucose tolerance testing, and 22q12-13 linked to fasting plasma glucose concentration. These results suggest loci that may harbor genes contributing to type 2 diabetes in Pima Indians. None of the linkages exceeded a LOD score of 3.6 (a 5% probability of occurring in a genome-wide scan). These findings must, therefore, be considered tentative until extended in this population or replicated in others.","Adult, Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22, Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3, Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4, Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2, Female, Genetic Linkage, Genotype, Humans, Indians, North American, Insulin, Lod Score, Male, Microsatellite Repeats, Polymorphism, Genetic, Prediabetic State",yes,yes,unk,yes,SA,9541507.0, An autosomal genomic scan for loci linked to prediabetic phenotypes in Pima Indians ,yes,yes,yes,Unknown,,False
11544614,Family and genetic studies of indices of insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion in Pima Indians,"The present analyses were conducted to examine the extent to which insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion, assessed using simple indices derived from an oral glucose tolerance test, are influenced by genetic factors, and to assess whether these genetic factors overlap with those influencing susceptibility to type 2 diabetes in Pima Indians.Indices calculated from fasting and 2-h post-load insulin (I(0), I(120)) and glucose (G(0), G(120)) concentrations included insulin sensitivity index [ISI(0)=10(4)/(I(0).G(0))] and corrected insulin response [CIR(120)=I(120)/[G(120).(G(120)-70 mg/dl)]]. Heritability (h(2)) was determined using variance components methods in 1421 non-diabetic individuals from 446 sibships. Among 595 individuals in 186 sibships, genome-wide quantitative trait linkage analyses of ISI(0) and CIR(120) were conducted and affected-sibling analyses of diabetic siblings stratified by prediabetic measurements of ISI(0) and CIR(120) were also performed.Both ISI(0) (h(2)=0.37+/-0.06) and CIR(120) (h(2)=0.25+/-0.07) were moderately heritable. Modest evidence for linkage with CIR(120) (logarithm of odds (LOD)=1.6) was observed on chromosome 1q in a region previously shown to have linkage with young-onset diabetes in Pimas. When diabetic siblings were stratified by CIR(120), evidence for linkage in this region was strongest (LOD=1.5) among those with a low CIR(120). Additional regions with modest evidence for linkage with ISI(0) were observed on chromosomes 9p (LOD=2.0) and 14p (LOD=1.7).The present analyses suggest that insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion are influenced by genetic factors in Pima Indians. The linkage analyses suggest that the putative diabetes-susceptibility gene on chromosome 1q affects insulin secretion.

29054530,A molecular morphometric approach to diabeticÂ kidney disease can link structure toÂ function and outcome,"Diabetic kidney disease is the leading cause of kidney failure. However, studies of molecular mechanisms of early kidney damage are lacking. Here we examined for possible linkage between transcriptional regulation and quantitative structural damage in early diabetic kidney disease in Pima Indians with type 2 diabetes. Tissue obtained from protocol kidney biopsies underwent genome-wide compartment-specific gene expression profiling and quantitative morphometric analysis. The ultrastructural lesion most strongly associated with transcriptional regulation was cortical interstitial fractional volume (VvInt), an index of tubule-interstitial damage. Transcriptional co-expression network analysis identified 1843 transcripts that correlated significantly with VvInt. These transcripts were enriched for pathways associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, migratory mechanisms, and tubular metabolic functions. Pathway network analysis identified IL-1Î² as a key upstream regulator of the inflammatory response and five transcription factors cooperating with p53 to regulate metabolic functions. VvInt-associated transcripts showed significant correlation with the urine albumin to creatinine ratio and measured glomerular filtration rate 10 years after biopsy, establishing a link between the early molecular events and long-term disease progression. Thus, molecular mechanisms active early in diabetic kidney disease were revealed by correlating intrarenal transcripts with quantitative morphometry and long-term outcomes. This provides a starting point for identification of urgently needed therapeutic targets and non-invasive biomarkers of early diabetic kidney disease.Copyright Â© 2017 International Society of Nephrology.

1569197,A variant insulin promoter in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus,"To test the hypothesis that alterations in regulatory regions of the insulin gene occur in a subset of patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), the promoter region was studied by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification directly from genomic DNA, followed by high-resolution polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions. By using this method a previously identified HincII polymorphism (GTTGAC to GTTGAG at position-56) in American Blacks was readily detected, indicating that single base changes could be observed. In the course of screening the insulin promoter from 40 American Black subjects with NIDDM, an apparent larger allele was found in two individuals. Both patients were shown to have in addition to a normal allele, a larger allele containing an 8-bp repeat, TGGTCTAA from positions -322 to -315 of the insulin promoter. To facilitate rapid screening for the 8-bp repeat, a high-resolution agarose gel electrophoretic analysis was adopted. DNA from American Black NIDDM subjects (n = 100) and nondiabetic subjects (n = 100) was PCR amplified and analyzed. The 8-bp repeat was present in five NIDDM subjects, and one nondiabetic subject. DNA from Mauritius Creoles, also of African ancestry, was analyzed, and the 8-bp repeat was present in 3 of 41 NIDDM subjects, and 0 of 41 nondiabetic subjects. Analysis of glucose metabolism in three presumed normal sibs of an NIDDM patient with an 8-bp repeat revealed that one sib had overt diabetes, and two sibs were glucose intolerant, but there was no consistent segregation of the insulin promoter variant with the diabetes phenotype. The variant promoter was not present in 35 Caucasian NIDDM patients or in 40 Pima Indians. To test the biological consequences of the 8-bp repeat sequence in the insulin promoter, a normal and variant promoter were subcloned into a luciferase plasmid, and reporter gene activity assessed by transient transfection into mouse insulinoma (beta TC1) and hamster insulinoma (HIT) cells. The promoter activity of the variant allele was found to be reduced to 37.9 +/- 10.3% of the activity of the normal promoter in HIT cells (P less than 0.01, n = 4), and 49.1 +/- 6.4% in beta TC1 cells (P less than 0.01, n = 6). These data thus suggest that a naturally occurring variant of the insulin promoter may contribute to the diabetes phenotype in 5-6% of Black NIDDM patients.","Alleles, Base Sequence, Cloning, Molecular, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2, Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel, Gene Frequency, Humans, Insulin, Molecular Sequence Data, Pedigree, Polymerase Chain Reaction, Promoter Regions, Genetic",yes,yes,unk,yes,SA,1569197.0, A variant insulin promoter in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus ,yes,yes,yes,ssa,,False
12829658,A functional variant in the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma2 promoter is associated with predictors of obesity and type 2 diabetes in Pima Indians,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma)-2 is a member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily that is expressed predominantly in adipocytes and is thought to have a role in energy homeostasis, adipogenesis, and insulin sensitivity. A functional single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) that predicts a proline to alanine substitution (Pro12Ala) within the coding region of this gene has previously been associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes in several populations. In this study, we identified several novel SNPs in the promoter region of PPARgamma2 and genotyped them, along with the previously identified Pro12Ala SNP. In 241 nondiabetic Pima subjects, the Pro12Ala was associated with whole-body insulin action (P = 0.05), hepatic insulin action (P = 0.03), and fasting plasma insulin concentrations (P = 0.01). One of the promoter SNPs positioned within a putative E2 box was in high linkage disequilibrium (/D'/ = 0.98) with the Pro12Ala. This promoter SNP was similarly associated with whole-body insulin action (P = 0.04) and hepatic insulin action (P = 0.05), but not fasting plasma insulin concentrations. Functional studies in transfected 3T3-L1 cells demonstrated that this single base substitution in the putative E2 box significantly altered transcriptional activity from a luciferase reporter construct. These data indicate that this promoter SNP, via its effect on PPARgamma2 expression, may also have functional consequences on PPARgamma2-activated pathways, and perhaps both the promoter SNP and the Pro12Ala contribute to PPARgamma2-related phenotypes.","3T3 Cells, Adult, Animals, Arizona, Blood Glucose, Diabetes Mellitus, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2, Genes, Reporter, Genetic Variation, Humans, Indians, North American, Insulin, Longitudinal Studies, Luciferases, Mice, Obesity, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide, Predictive Value of Tests, Promoter Regions, Genetic, Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear, Transcription Factors, Transfection",yes,yes,unk,yes,SA,12829658.0, A functional variant in the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma2 promoter is associated with predictors of obesity and type 2 diabetes in Pima Indians ,yes,yes,yes,Unknown,,False
8842598,Effect of maternal diabetes on the pattern of selected insulin resistance syndrome parameters in normal glucose tolerant subjects of two Algonquin Indian communities in Quebec,"To determine whether a maternal antecedent with diabetes has an effect on insulin resistance syndrome parameters.We studied 352 Algonquin Indians from Quebec aged at least 15 years who had no personal antecedents with diabetes. Data concerned clinical and biological parameters and the parental antecedents with diabetes.For subjects over > 30 years, fasting insulin and cholesterol levels were significantly higher in the group with a maternal history of diabetes than in the group with a paternal history. Significant differences were observed for serum triglyceride, BMI, and subscapular skinfold thickness when comparing subjects with a maternal history and those with no parental history of diabetes. Blood pressure and fasting glucose did not differ according to parental history.Subjects of maternal antecedents with diabetes have known risk factors for NIDDM.

8636258,Examination of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase gene promoter in patients with noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus,"Expression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), a rate-limiting enzyme in gluconeogenesis, is under dominant negative regulation by insulin. In this study, we sought to test the hypothesis that mutations in the PEPCK gene promoter may impair the ability of insulin to suppress hepatic glucose production, thereby contributing to both the insulin resistance and increased rate of gluconeogenesis characteristic of NIDDM. The proximal PEPCK promoter region in 117 patients with noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and 20 obese Pima Indians was amplified by PCR and analyzed with single strand conformation polymorphism techniques. In addition, limited direct DNA sequencing was performed on the insulin response sequence and flanking regions. No DNA sequence polymorphisms were found in any patient. This result suggests that mutations in cis-acting PEPCK gene regulatory elements do not constitute a common cause of noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. The significance of genetic variation in promoter regions to human disease is discussed.","Adolescent, Adult, Base Sequence, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2, Gluconeogenesis, Humans, Insulin, Insulin Resistance, Liver, Molecular Sequence Data, Mutation, Phosphoenolpyruvate Carboxykinase (GTP), Promoter Regions, Genetic",yes,yes,unk,yes,SA,8636258.0, Examination of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase gene promoter in patients with noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus ,yes,yes,yes,Unknown,,False
9973549,Genome-wide scan for CAG/CTG repeat expansions in Pimas with early onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus,"The expansion of polymorphic CAG/CTG repeats in specific genes causes several neurodegenerative disorders and in many instances the length of the disease-causing repeat correlates with the onset age and/or severity of symptoms. Type 2 diabetes mellitus has features in common with diseases resulting from trinucleotide repeat expansion, including a variable age of disease onset and penetrance. We have investigated whether CAG/CTG repeat expansion contributes to the genetic etiology of type 2 diabetes in the Pima Indians, a population with the highest reported prevalence of this disease. Using the Repeat Expansion Detection (RED) method, we determined the size range in nondiabetic Pimas to be between (CAG)20 and (CAG)130 (mean repeat length = 195 bp), which is significantly larger than the mean size reported in Caucasians (150 bp). We compared the distribution of CAG/CTG repeat lengths among 40 Pimas with an early onset of type 2 diabetes (<22 years) and 38 nondiabetic subjects (>55 years). A 240-bp CAG/CTG RED product was found more frequently in early onset diabetics relative to nondiabetic controls (26% vs 11%), whereas a 210-bp band was more prominent in unaffected subjects (29% vs 13%); however, these differences were not statistically significant. In one Pima kindred, we also identified large RED products (>/=360 bp) that displayed intergenerational instability among family members. However, these expansions were not associated with diabetes or any other clinical abnormalities in the carriers. We conclude that this unstable CAG/CTG repeat may represent a novel locus, consisting of large, but apparently nonpathogenic, unstable sequences.","Age of Onset, Alleles, Arizona, DNA, Data Interpretation, Statistical, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2, Gene Frequency, Genetic Markers, Genetic Testing, Genome, Human, Genotype, Humans, Indians, North American, Pedigree, Polymorphism, Genetic, Trinucleotide Repeat Expansion",yes,yes,unk,yes,SA,9973549.0, Genome-wide scan for CAG/CTG repeat expansions in Pimas with early onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus ,yes,yes,yes,Unknown,,False
12618085,A C-reactive protein promoter polymorphism is associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus in Pima Indians,"Linkage analysis has identified a susceptibility locus for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) on chromosome 1q21-q23 in several populations. Results from recent prospective studies indicate that increased levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker of immune system activation, are predictive of diabetes, independent of adiposity. Because CRP is located on 1q21, we considered it a potential positional candidate gene for T2DM. We therefore evaluated CRP and the nearby serum amyloid P-component, APCS, which is structurally similar to CRP, as candidate diabetes susceptibility genes. Approximately 10.9kb of the CRP-APCS locus was screened for polymorphisms using denaturing high performance liquid chromatography and direct sequencing. We identified 27 informative polymorphisms, including 26 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 1 insertion/deletion, which were divided into 7 linkage disequilibrium clusters. We genotyped representative SNPs in approximately 1300 Pima samples and found a single variant in the CRP promoter (SNP 133552) that was associated with T2DM (P=0.014), as well as a common haplotype (CGCG) that was associated with both T2DM (P=0.029) and corrected insulin response, a surrogate measure of insulin secretion in non-diabetic subjects (P=0.050). Linkage analyses that adjusted for the effect of these polymorphisms indicated that they do not in themselves account for the observed linkage with T2DM on chromosome 1q. However, these findings suggest that variation within the CRP locus may play a role in diabetes susceptibility in Pima Indians.","Base Sequence, C-Reactive Protein, DNA Primers, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2, Humans, Indians, North American, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide, Promoter Regions, Genetic",yes,yes,unk,yes,SA,12618085.0, A C-reactive protein promoter polymorphism is associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus in Pima Indians ,yes,yes,yes,Unknown,,False

We assess tag SNPs across these loci for associations with T2DM in American Indians.A total of 435 SNPs that tag (R2 Â â‰¥Â .85) common variation across the 8 loci were analyzed for association with T2DM (nÂ =Â 7710), early onset T2DM (nÂ =Â 1060), body mass index (nÂ =Â 6839), insulin sensitivity (nÂ =Â 555), and insulin secretion (nÂ =Â 298).Tag SNPs within FITM2-R3HDML-HNF4A, GLIS3, KCNK16, and ZFAND3 associated with T2DM after accounting for locus-wide multiple testing.

25667308,Role of Established Type 2 Diabetes-Susceptibility Genetic Variants in a High Prevalence American Indian Population,"Several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have been identified, but there is little information on their role in populations at high risk for T2DM. We genotyped SNPs at 63 T2DM loci in 3,421 individuals from a high-risk American Indian population. Nominally significant (P < 0.05) associations were observed at nine SNPs in a direction consistent with the established association. A genetic risk score derived from all loci was strongly associated with T2DM (odds ratio 1.05 per risk allele, P = 6.2 Ã— 10(-6)) and, in 292 nondiabetic individuals, with lower insulin secretion (by 4% per copy, P = 4.1 Ã— 10(-6)). Genetic distances between American Indians and HapMap populations at T2DM markers did not differ significantly from genomic expectations. Analysis of U.S. national survey data suggested that 66% of the difference in T2DM prevalence between African Americans and European Americans, but none of the difference between American Indians and European Americans, was attributable to allele frequency differences at these loci. These analyses suggest that, in general, established T2DM loci influence T2DM in American Indians and that risk is mediated in part through an effect on insulin secretion. However, differences in allele frequencies do not account for the high population prevalence of T2DM.Â© 2015 by the American Diabetes Association.

We investigated the association of these single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and some additional tag SNPs with type 2 diabetes and related quantitative traits in Pima Indians.Forty-seven SNPs were genotyped in 3,501 Pima Indians informative for type 2 diabetes and BMI, among whom 370 had measures of quantitative traits.FTO provided the strongest evidence for replication, where SNPs were associated with type 2 diabetes (odds ratio = 1.20 per copy of the risk allele, P = 0.03) and BMI (P = 0.002). None of the other previously reported SNPs were associated with type 2 diabetes; however, associations were found between CDKAL1 and HHEX variants and acute insulin response (AIR), where the Caucasian risk alleles for type 2 diabetes were associated with reduced insulin secretion in normoglycemic Pima Indians. Multiallelic analyses of carrying risk alleles for multiple genes showed correlations between number of risk alleles and type 2 diabetes and impaired insulin secretion in normoglycemic subjects (P = 0.006 and 0.0001 for type 2 diabetes and AIR, respectively), supporting the hypothesis that many of these genes influence diabetes risk by affecting insulin secretion.Variation in FTO impacts BMI, but the implicated common variants in the other genes did not confer a significant risk for type 2 diabetes in Pima Indians. However, confidence intervals for their estimated effects were consistent with the small effects reported in Caucasians, and the multiallelic ""genetic risk profile"" identified in Caucasians is associated with diminished early insulin secretion in Pima Indians.","Adolescent, Adult, Alpha-Ketoglutarate-Dependent Dioxygenase FTO, Cation Transport Proteins, Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 5, Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2, Female, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, Genome-Wide Association Study, Genotype, Homeodomain Proteins, Humans, Indians, North American, Male, Middle Aged, N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferases, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide, Proteins, Quantitative Trait Loci, RNA-Binding Proteins, Transcription Factors, Young Adult, Zinc Transporter 8, tRNA Methyltransferases",yes,yes,unk,yes,SA,19008344.0," Association analysis of variation in/near FTO, CDKAL1, SLC30A8, HHEX, EXT2, IGF2BP2, LOC387761, and CDKN2B with type 2 diabetes and related quantitative traits in Pima Indians ",yes,yes,yes,Unknown,,False

Adiponectin concentrations were heritable, with 39% of the variance of age- and sex-adjusted adiponectin potentially accounted for by additive genetic influences in this population. In genome-wide linkage analyses, suggestive linkage (logarithm of odds [LOD] = 3.0) of adiponectin adjusted for age and sex was found on chromosome 9p at 18 cM.

26408818,T-cell receptor repertoire variation may be associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus in humans,"Recent work in Pima Indians, a population with high rates of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), demonstrated that human leukocyte antigen haplotype DRB1*02 carriers have an increased acute insulin response and decreased risk for the development of T2DM, implicating loss of self-tolerance in the pathogenesis of T2DM. Advances in genomic sequencing have made T-cell receptor repertoire analysis a practical mode of investigation.High-throughput sequencing of T-cell receptor complementarity-determining region 3 was carried out in male Pima Indians with normal glucose regulation (nâ€‰=â€‰11; ageâ€‰=â€‰31â€‰Â±â€‰8 years; %fatâ€‰=â€‰30.2â€‰Â±â€‰8.7%) and the protective DRB1*02 haplotype versus those with T2DM without DRB1*02 (nâ€‰=â€‰7; ageâ€‰=â€‰34â€‰Â±â€‰8 years; %fatâ€‰=â€‰31.2â€‰Â±â€‰4.7%).

Of these subjects, 13 developed diabetes.T-cell receptor complementarity-determining region 3 length was shorter in those with T2DM, and a one-nucleotide decrease in complementarity-determining region 3 length was associated with a nearly threefold increase in risk for future diabetes. The frequency of one variable gene, TRBV7-8, was higher in those with T2DM. A 1% increase in TRBV7-8 frequency was associated with a greater than threefold increase in diabetes risk.These results indicate that T-cell autoimmunity may be an important component in progression to T2DM in Pima Indians.Copyright Â© 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Adult, Complementarity Determining Regions, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2, Female, Glucose Tolerance Test, HLA-DRB1 Chains, Haplotypes, Humans, Indians, North American, Longitudinal Studies, Male, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide, Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell",yes,yes,unk,yes,SA,26408818.0, T-cell receptor repertoire variation may be associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus in humans ,yes,yes,yes,Unknown,,False
31561379,Discovery of Gut Bacteria Specific to Alzheimer's Associated Diseases is a Clue to Understanding Disease Etiology: Meta-Analysis of Population-Based Data on Human Gut Metagenomics and Metabolomics,"Alzheimer's disease (AD)-associated sequence (ADAS) of cultured fecal bacteria was discovered in human gut targeted screening. This study provides important information to expand our current understanding of the structure/activity relationship of ADAS and putative inhibitors/activators that are potentially involved in ADAS appearance/disappearance. The NCBI database analysis revealed that ADAS presents at a large proportion in American Indian Oklahoman (C&A) with a high prevalence of obesity/diabetes and in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients from the US and China. An Oklahoman non-native group (NNI) showed no ADAS. Comparison of two large US populations reveals that ADAS is more frequent in individuals aged â‰¥66 and in females. Prevalence and levels of fecal metabolites are altered in the C&A and CRC groups versus controls. Biogenic amines (histamine, tryptamine, tyramine, phenylethylamine, cadaverine, putrescine, agmatine, spermidine) that present in food and are produced by gut microbiota are significantly higher in C&A (e.g., histamine/histidine 95-fold) versus NNI (histamine/histidine 16-fold). The majority of these bio-amines are cytotoxic at concentrations found in food. Inositol phosphate signaling implicated in AD is altered in C&A and CRC. Tryptamine stimulated accumulation of inositol phosphate. The seizure-eliciting tryptamine induced cytoplasmic vacuolization and vesiculation with cell fragmentation. Present additions of ADAS-carriers at different ages including infants led to an ADAS-comprising human sample size of 2,830 from 27 studies from four continents (North America, Australia, Asia, Europe). Levels of food-derived monoamine oxidase inhibitors and anti-bacterial compounds, the potential modulators of ADAS-bacteria growth and biogenic amine production, were altered in C&A versus NNI. ADAS is attributable to potentially modifiable risk factors of AD associated diseases.","Alzheimer Disease, Case-Control Studies, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Humans, Metabolomics, Metagenomics, Population Surveillance",yes,no,unk,no,SA,31561379.0, Discovery of Gut Bacteria Specific to Alzheimer's Associated Diseases is a Clue to Understanding Disease Etiology: Meta-Analysis of Population-Based Data on Human Gut Metagenomics and Metabolomics ,yes,yes,no,Unknown,,False

24358131,A genome-wide search for linkage of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in the Family Investigation of Nephropathy and Diabetes (FIND),"Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), a measure of kidney function, is heritable, suggesting that genes influence renal function. Genes that influence eGFR have been identified through genome-wide association studies. However, family-based linkage approaches may identify loci that explain a larger proportion of the heritability. This study used genome-wide linkage and association scans to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) that influence eGFR.Genome-wide linkage and sparse association scans of eGFR were performed in families ascertained by probands with advanced diabetic nephropathy (DN) from the multi-ethnic Family Investigation of Nephropathy and Diabetes (FIND) study. This study included 954 African Americans (AA), 781 American Indians (AI), 614 European Americans (EA) and 1,611 Mexican Americans (MA). A total of 3,960 FIND participants were genotyped for 6,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using the Illumina Linkage IVb panel. GFR was estimated by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula.The non-parametric linkage analysis, accounting for the effects of diabetes duration and BMI, identified the strongest evidence for linkage of eGFR on chromosome 20q11 (log of the odds [LOD] = 3.34; P = 4.4 Ã— 10(-5)) in MA and chromosome 15q12 (LOD = 2.84; P = 1.5 Ã— 10(-4)) in EA. In all subjects, the strongest linkage signal for eGFR was detected on chromosome 10p12 (P = 5.5 Ã— 10(-4)) at 44 cM near marker rs1339048. A subsequent association scan in both ancestry-specific groups and the entire population identified several SNPs significantly associated with eGFR across the genome.The present study describes the localization of QTL influencing eGFR on 20q11 in MA, 15q21 in EA and 10p12 in the combined ethnic groups participating in the FIND study.

The multicenter FIND consortium aims to identify genes for DN and its associated quantitative traits, e.g. the urine albumin:creatinine ratio (ACR). Herein, the results of whole-genome linkage analysis and a sparse association scan for ACR and a dichotomous DN phenotype are reported in diabetic individuals.A genomewide scan comprising more than 5,500 autosomal single nucleotide polymorphism markers (average spacing of 0.6 cM) was performed on 1,235 nuclear and extended pedigrees (3,972 diabetic participants) ascertained for DN from African-American (AA), American-Indian (AI), European-American (EA) and Mexican-American (MA) populations.Strong evidence for linkage to DN was detected on chromosome 6p (p = 8.0 Ã— 10(-5), LOD = 3.09) in EA families as well as suggestive evidence for linkage to chromosome 7p in AI families. Regions on chromosomes 3p in AA, 7q in EA, 16q in AA and 22q in MA displayed suggestive evidence of linkage for urine ACR.

20511394,Optimizing a proteomics platform for urine biomarker discovery,"Biomarker discovery approaches in urine have been hindered by concerns for reproducibility and inadequate standardization of proteomics protocols. In this study, we describe an optimized quantitative proteomics strategy for urine biomarker discovery, which is applicable to fresh or long frozen samples. We used urine from healthy controls to standardize iTRAQ (isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation) for variation induced by protease inhibitors, starting protein and iTRAQ label quantities, protein extraction methods, and depletion of albumin and immunoglobulin G (IgG). We observed the following: (a) Absence of protease inhibitors did not affect the number or identity of the high confidence proteins. (b) Use of less than 20 Î¼g of protein per sample led to a significant drop in the number of identified proteins. (c) Use of as little as a quarter unit of an iTRAQ label did not affect the number or identity of the identified proteins. (d) Protein extraction by methanol precipitation led to the highest protein yields and the most reproducible spectra. (e) Depletion of albumin and IgG did not increase the number of identified proteins or deepen the proteome coverage. Applying this optimized protocol to four pairs of long frozen urine samples from diabetic Pima Indians with or without nephropathy, we observed patterns suggesting segregation of cases and controls by iTRAQ spectra. We also identified several previously reported candidate biomarkers that showed trends toward differential expression, albeit not reaching statistical significance in this small sample set.","Albuminuria, Biomarkers, Case-Control Studies, Diabetes Mellitus, Humans, Immunoglobulin G, Male, Proteomics",no,no,unk,yes,SA,20511394.0, Optimizing a proteomics platform for urine biomarker discovery ,yes,yes,yes,Unknown,,False
27142425,"Selecting SNPs informative for African, American Indian and European Ancestry: application to the Family Investigation of Nephropathy and Diabetes (FIND)","The presence of population structure in a sample may confound the search for important genetic loci associated with disease. Our four samples in the Family Investigation of Nephropathy and Diabetes (FIND), European Americans, Mexican Americans, African Americans, and American Indians are part of a genome- wide association study in which population structure might be particularly important. We therefore decided to study in detail one component of this, individual genetic ancestry (IGA). From SNPs present on the Affymetrix 6.0 Human SNP array, we identified 3 sets of ancestry informative markers (AIMs), each maximized for the information in one the three contrasts among ancestral populations: Europeans (HAPMAP, CEU), Africans (HAPMAP, YRI and LWK), and Native Americans (full heritage Pima Indians). We estimate IGA and present an algorithm for their standard errors, compare IGA to principal components, emphasize the importance of balancing information in the ancestry informative markers (AIMs), and test the association of IGA with diabetic nephropathy in the combined sample.A fixed parental allele maximum likelihood algorithm was applied to the FIND to estimate IGA in four samples: 869 American Indians; 1385 African Americans; 1451 Mexican Americans; and 826 European Americans. When the information in the AIMs is unbalanced, the estimates are incorrect with large error. Individual genetic admixture is highly correlated with principle components for capturing population structure. It takes ~700 SNPs to reduce the average standard error of individual admixture below 0.01. When the samples are combined, the resulting population structure creates associations between IGA and diabetic nephropathy.The identified set of AIMs, which include American Indian parental allele frequencies, may be particularly useful for estimating genetic admixture in populations from the Americas. Failure to balance information in maximum likelihood, poly-ancestry models creates biased estimates of individual admixture with large error. This also occurs when estimating IGA using the Bayesian clustering method as implemented in the program STRUCTURE. Odds ratios for the associations of IGA with disease are consistent with what is known about the incidence and prevalence of diabetic nephropathy in these populations.","Algorithms, Black or African American, Chromosome Mapping, Diabetic Nephropathies, Genetic Markers, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, Genome-Wide Association Study, Humans, Indians, North American, Likelihood Functions, Mexican Americans, Models, Genetic, Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide, Principal Component Analysis, United States, White People",yes,yes,"na, ssa, we",yes,SA,27142425.0," Selecting SNPs informative for African, American Indian and European Ancestry: application to the Family Investigation of Nephropathy and Diabetes (FIND) ",yes,yes,yes,Unknown,,False

By positional cloning in the 7q21.3-q22.1 region linked with insulin resistance and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in the Pima Indians, we identified a gene encoding an additional human PDK isoform, as evidenced by its amino acid sequence identity (>65%) with other mammalian PDKs, and confirmed by biochemical analyses of the recombinant protein. We performed detailed comparative analyses of the gene, termed PDK4, in insulin-resistant and insulin-sensitive Pima Indians, and detected five DNA variants with comparable frequencies in both subject groups. Using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, we found that the variants identified in the promoter and 5'-untranslated region did not correlate with differences in mRNA level in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. We conclude that alterations in PDK4 are unlikely to be the molecular basis underlying the observed linkage at 7q21.3-q22.1 in the Pima Indians. Information about the genomic organization and promoter sequences of PDK4 will be useful in studies of other members of this family of mitochondrial protein kinases that are important for the regulation of glucose metabolism.","Adipose Tissue, Amino Acid Sequence, Base Sequence, Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7, Cloning, Molecular, DNA, Complementary, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2, Humans, Indians, North American, Isoenzymes, Molecular Sequence Data, Muscle, Skeletal, Polymerase Chain Reaction, Protein Kinases, Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases, Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Acetyl-Transferring Kinase, RNA, Messenger, Sequence Homology, Amino Acid, Tissue Distribution",yes,yes,unk,yes,SA,8798399.0, Cloning and characterization of PDK4 on 7q21.3 encoding a fourth pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoenzyme in human ,no,yes,yes,Unknown,,False
19369405,Linkage analysis of albuminuria,"American Indians have a higher prevalence of albuminuria than the general population, likely resulting from a combination of environmental and genetic risk factors. To localize gene regions influencing variation in urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio, we performed a linkage analysis and explored gene-by-diabetes, -hypertension, and -obesity interactions in a large cohort of American Indian families. We recruited >3600 individuals from 13 American Indian tribes from three centers (Arizona, North and South Dakota, and Oklahoma). We performed multipoint variance component linkage analysis in each center as well as in the entire cohort after controlling for center effects. We used two modeling strategies: Model 1 incorporated age, gender, and interaction terms; model 2 also controlled for diabetes, BP, body mass index, HDL, LDL, triglycerides, and smoking status. We evaluated interactions with diabetes, hypertension, and obesity using additive, interaction-specific linkage and stratified analyses. Loci suggestive for linkage to urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio included 1q, 6p, 9q, 18q, and 20p.

American Indians suffer disproportionately high rates of obesity and diabetes. The goal of this study is to identify metabolic profiles of obesity in 431 normoglycemic American Indians participating in the Strong Heart Family Study. Using an untargeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, we detected 1,364 distinct m/z features matched to known compounds in the current metabolomics databases. We conducted multivariate analysis to identify metabolic profiles for obesity, adjusting for standard obesity indicators. After adjusting for covariates and multiple testing, five metabolites were associated with body mass index and seven were associated with waist circumference. Of them, three were associated with both. Majority of the obesity-related metabolites belongs to lipids, e.g., fatty amides, sphingolipids, prenol lipids, and steroid derivatives. Other identified metabolites are amino acids or peptides. Of the nine identified metabolites, five metabolites (oleoylethanolamide, mannosyl-diinositol-phosphorylceramide, pristanic acid, glutamate, and kynurenine) have been previously implicated in obesity or its related pathways.

34676581,Virtual screening of functional foods and dissecting their roles in modulating gene functions to support post COVID-19 complications,"COVID-19 has become the focal point since 2019 after the outbreak of coronavirus disease. Many drugs are being tested and used to treat coronavirus infections; different kinds of vaccines are also introduced as preventive measure. Alternative therapeutics are as well incorporated into the health guidelines of some countries. This research aimed to look into the underlying mechanisms of functional foods and how they may improve the long-term post COVID-19 cardiovascular, diabetic, and respiratory complications through their bioactive compounds. The potentiality of nine functional foods for post COVID-19 complications was investigated through computational approaches. A total of 266 bioactive compounds of these foods were searched via extensive literature reviewing. Three highly associated targets namely troponin I interacting kinase (TNNI3K), dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4), and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-Î²1) were selected for cardiovascular, diabetes, and respiratory disorders, respectively, after COVID-19 infections. Best docked compounds were further analyzed by network pharmacological tools to explore their interactions with complication-related genes (MAPK1 and HSP90AA1 for cardiovascular, PPARG and TNF-alpha for diabetes, and AKT-1 for respiratory disorders). Seventy-one suggested compounds out of one-hundred and thirty-nine (139) docked compounds in network pharmacology recommended 169 Gene Ontology (GO) items and 99 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes signaling pathways preferably AKT signaling pathway, MAPK signaling pathway, ACE2 receptor signaling pathway, insulin signaling pathway, and PPAR signaling pathway. Among the chosen functional foods, black cumin, fenugreek, garlic, ginger, turmeric, bitter melon, and Indian pennywort were found to modulate the actions. Results demonstrate that aforesaid functional foods have attenuating roles to manage post COVID-19 complications. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Functional foods have been approaching a greater interest due to their medicinal uses other than gastronomic pleasure. Nine functional food resources have been used in this research for their traditional and ethnopharmacological uses, but their directive-role in modulating the genes involved in the management of post COVID-19 complications is inadequately studied and reported. Therefore, the foods types used in this research may be prioritized to be used as functional foods for ameliorating the major post COVID-19 complications through appropriate science.Â© 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",,no,yes,Unknown,no,SA,34676581.0, Virtual screening of functional foods and dissecting their roles in modulating gene functions to support post COVID-19 complications ,yes,yes,yes,not specified,,False
22403240,Associations between incident ischemic stroke events and stroke and cardiovascular disease-related genome-wide association studies single nucleotide polymorphisms in the Population Architecture Using Genomics and Epidemiology study,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified loci associated with ischemic stroke (IS) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in European-descent individuals, but their replication in different populations has been largely unexplored.Nine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) selected from GWAS and meta-analyses of stroke, and 86 SNPs previously associated with myocardial infarction and CVD risk factors, including blood lipids (high density lipoprotein [HDL], low density lipoprotein [LDL], and triglycerides), type 2 diabetes, and body mass index (BMI), were investigated for associations with incident IS in European Americans (EA) N=26 276, African-Americans (AA) N=8970, and American Indians (AI) N=3570 from the Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology Study. Ancestry-specific fixed effects meta-analysis with inverse variance weighting was used to combine study-specific log hazard ratios from Cox proportional hazards models. Two of 9 stroke SNPs (rs783396 and rs1804689) were significantly associated with [corrected] IS hazard in AA; none were significant in this large EA cohort. Of 73 CVD risk factor SNPs tested in EA, 2 (HDL and triglycerides SNPs) were associated with IS. In AA, SNPs associated with LDL, HDL, and BMI were significantly associated with IS (3 of 86 SNPs tested). Out of 58 SNPs tested in AI, 1 LDL SNP was significantly associated with IS.Our analyses showing lack of replication in spite of reasonable power for many stroke SNPs and differing results by ancestry highlight the need to follow up on GWAS findings and conduct genetic association studies in diverse populations. We found modest IS associations with BMI and lipids SNPs, though these findings require confirmation.","Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Cardiovascular Diseases, Cholesterol, HDL, Cholesterol, LDL, Female, Genetics, Population, Genome-Wide Association Study, Genomics, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide, Risk Factors, Stroke, Triglycerides, White People",yes,no,"we, ssa, na",yes,SA,22403240.0, Associations between incident ischemic stroke events and stroke and cardiovascular disease-related genome-wide association studies single nucleotide polymorphisms in the Population Architecture Using Genomics and Epidemiology study ,yes,yes,yes,Unknown,,False
9158141,Structure and sequence variation at the human leptin receptor gene in lean and obese Pima Indians,"The cloning of human and mouse cDNAs from brain that encode high affinity leptin receptors was recently reported. We have physically localized the human leptin receptor gene (LEPR) to a region at 1p31, between the anonymous microsatellite markers D1S515 and D1S198. The genomic structure of the human leptin receptor gene, corresponding to the published human brain cDNA sequence, spans over 70 kb and includes 20 exons. Since the leptin receptor gene is a candidate gene for obesity, and because of its proximity to D1S198, a marker previously linked to insulin secretion, the LEPR gene was sequenced in 20 non-diabetic Pima Indians chosen for extremes in percent body fat and in their acute insulin response to intravenous glucose. Seven polymorphic sites were identified. Two of these polymorphisms, Lys109Arg and Gln223Arg, are amino acid substitutions in the extracellular domain of the leptin receptor, one polymorphism is a silent substitution, and four occur in non-coding regions of the leptin receptor. Four of these sites are in linkage disequilibrium with one another. Nucleotides at three noncoding polymorphic sites were found exclusively in obese Pima Indians. This demonstrates an association between variation at the leptin receptor gene and obesity in humans.","Adipose Tissue, Base Sequence, Carrier Proteins, Exons, Female, Gene Frequency, Genetic Variation, Genetics, Population, Haplotypes, Humans, Indians, North American, Introns, Linkage Disequilibrium, Male, Molecular Sequence Data, Obesity, Polymerase Chain Reaction, Polymorphism, Genetic, Receptors, Cell Surface, Receptors, Leptin, Sequence Analysis, DNA, White People",yes,no,unk,yes,SA,9158141.0, Structure and sequence variation at the human leptin receptor gene in lean and obese Pima Indians ,yes,no,yes,Unknown,,False
2318937,The amino acid sequence of the insulin receptor is normal in an insulin-resistant Pima Indian,"Insulin resistance is an early predictor of development of noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) in Pima Indians, a population with the highest reported prevalence of NIDDM. The insulin receptor plays a central role in mediating insulin action, and previous studies have demonstrated that mutations in the insulin receptor gene may cause insulin resistance. Therefore, we have cloned the insulin receptor cDNA from an insulin-resistant Pima Indian to determine if there is a mutation in the patient's insulin receptor gene. We obtained nine cDNA clones spanning exons 4-10 and 12-22 of the patient's insulin receptor gene. Polymorphisms in the nucleotide sequences for codons 523 (Ala), 1058 (His), and 1062 (Leu) provided useful markers to differentiate the patient's two alleles of the insulin receptor gene. These substitutions were silent, in that they did not alter the predicted amino acid sequence. The sequence of exons 1-3 and 11 was determined directly from genomic DNA that had been amplified using the polymerase chain reaction catalyzed by Taq DNA polymerase. Other investigators have reported defects in insulin binding and insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity in diabetic Pima Indians. However, we did not detect any mutations in this patient's insulin receptor gene. Thus, these observations are consistent with the interpretation that the defects in insulin receptor function are acquired rather than derived from defects in the primary structure of the receptor.","Adult, Alleles, Amino Acid Sequence, Base Sequence, Cloning, Molecular, DNA, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2, Exons, Humans, Indians, North American, Insulin Resistance, Male, Molecular Sequence Data, Pedigree, Polymerase Chain Reaction, Receptor, Insulin",yes,yes,unk,yes,SA,2318937.0, The amino acid sequence of the insulin receptor is normal in an insulin-resistant Pima Indian ,yes,yes,yes,Unknown,,False
32623090,"Ethnicity, age and disease-associated variation in body fluid-specific CpG sites in a diverse South African cohort","Tissue-specific differential DNA methylation has been an attractive target for the development of markers for discrimination of body fluids found at crime scenes. Though mostly stable, DNA methylation patterns have been shown to vary between different ethnic groups, in different age groups as well as between healthy and diseased individuals. To the best of our knowledge, none of the markers for body fluid identification have been applied to different ethnic groups to ascertain if variability exists. In the present study, saliva and blood were collected to determine the effects of ethnicity (Blacks, Whites, Coloureds and Indians), age (20-30 years, 40-50years and above 60 years) and diabetes on methylation profiles of potential saliva- and blood-specific DMSs. Both DMSs were previously shown to exhibit hypermethylation in their target body fluids at single CpG sites, however in the present study, additional CpG sites flanking the reported sites were also screened. Bisulfite sequencing revealed that Coloureds showed highest methylation levels for both body fluids, and blacks displayed significant differences between other ethnic groups in the blood-specific CpG sites. A decline in methylation for both potential DMRs was observed with increasing age. Heavily methylated CpG sites in different ethnic groups and previously reported DMSs displayed hypomethylation with increasing age and disease status. Diabetic status did not show any significant difference in methylation when compared to healthy counterparts. Thus, the use of methylation markers for forensics needs thorough investigation of influence of external factors and ideally, several CpG sites should be co-analysed instead of a single DMS.Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier B.V.

We conducted this meta-analysis to evaluate the effects of sitagliptin on serum lipids in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.We made a comprehensive literature search in PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang, and VIP database until June 2015. Eligible studies were randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that investigated the effect of sitagliptin on serum triglycerides (TGs), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), or high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C).Eleven RCTs with 2338 patients were identified.

Subgroup analyses revealed that sitagliptin alone achieved greater improvement in serum TG, TC, and HDL-C levels.These findings suggested that sitagliptin alone or in combination significantly improved serum TG and HDL-C levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.","Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2, Dipeptidyl-Peptidase IV Inhibitors, Dyslipidemias, Humans, Lipid Metabolism, Lipids, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic, Sitagliptin Phosphate",no,yes,Unknown,no,EA,26765417.0, Effects of Sitagliptin on Lipid Profiles in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A Meta-analysis of Randomized Clinical Trials ,no,yes,no,ea,,False
32442586,NMR-based metabolomic analysis for the effects of Huiyang Shengji extract on rat diabetic skin ulcers,"Huiyang Shengji formula (HSF) is a compound Chinese herbal medicine prescription, and has long been used for treating chronic non-healing wounds.The purpose of this study was to provide new insight into molecular mechanisms of healing effects of the HSF treatments.We established a rat diabetic skin ulcer (DSU) model, and assessed healing effects of four HSF treatments on DSUs by calculating wound healing rates and immunohistochemical detection of the expressions of angiogenesis-related factors in the model rats (Mod) relative to normal rats (Nor), including Huiyang extract (HE), Shengji extract (SE), Huiyang Shengji extract (HSE) and HSE associated with acupuncture (Ac-HSE). We then performed NMR-based metabolomic analyses on skin tissues of the Nor, Mod, HSE-treated, Ac-HSE-treated rats to address metabolic mechanisms underlying these effects.These treatments up-regulated expressions of two angiogenesis-related factors VEGF and CD31, and improved efficacy of healing DSUs, in which HSE and Ac-HSE exhibited the most significant effects. Compared with Mod, HSE and Ac-HSE groups shared four characteristic metabolites (lactate, histidine, succinate and acetate) and four significantly altered metabolic pathways with Nor. Both HSE and Ac-HSE treatments could partly reverse the metabolically disordered pathological state of DSUs to the normal state. They might improve wound healing through promoting glucose metabolism, BCAAs metabolism, and enhancing antioxidant capacity and angiogenesis in DSU tissues. Ac-HSE significantly enhanced wound healing rates compared to HSE, potentially owing to significant capacities of enhancing anti-oxidation and angiogenesis and interfering three more metabolic pathways.This work provides a mechanistic understanding of the healing effects of the HSE and Ac-HSE treatments on DSUs, is of benefit to improvements of the HSF treatments for clinically healing chronic non-healing wounds.Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Human mannosidosis, an inherited glycoprotein storage disorder, has been associated with severe deficiency of both lysosomal alpha-mannosidase B molecular forms. Chromosome assignment of the gene coding for human alpha-mannosidase B (MANB) has been determined in human-mouse and human-Chinese hamster somatic cell hybrids. The human alpha-mannosidase B phenotype showed concordant segregation with the human enzyme glucosephosphate isomerase (GPI) (D-glucose-6-phosphate ketolisomerase, EC 5.3.1.9) but discordant segregation with 30 other enzyme markers representing 20 linkage groups. The glucose-phosphate isomerase gene has been assigned to chromosome 19 in man. This MANB-GPI linkage and confirming chromosome studies demonstrate assignment of the alpha-mannosidase B structural gene to chromosome 19 in man. Since mannosidosis is believed to result from a structural defect in alpha-mannosidase B, these findings suggest that the mannosidosis mutation is located on chromosome 19 in man.","Animals, Carbohydrate Metabolism, Inborn Errors, Chromosome Mapping, Chromosomes, Human, 19-20, Cricetinae, Disaccharidases, Genes, Glucose-6-Phosphate Isomerase, Humans, Hybrid Cells, Lysosomes, Mannosidases, Mice",yes,no,ea,yes,EA,318154.0, Mannosidosis: assignment of the lysosomal alpha-mannosidase B gene to chromosome 19 in man ,no,no,yes,we,,False

But the therapy target was unclear.In this study, we used the serum proteome labeled by iTRAQ to find therapy target of YQYYHTQY recipe on T2DM.The rat model was induced by high-fat diet (HFD) and streptozotocin (STZ, 30â€¯mg/kg). Drugs were administered to rats once daily for 14 days. Related laboratory parameters were observed. Serum proteome were compared between T2DM and YQYYHTQY group using the iTRAQ labeling quantitative proteomics technique. Functional differential proteins were analysis by STRING software.

28606513,Serum metabolomics analysis reveals that obvious cardioprotective effects of low dose Sini decoction against isoproterenol-induced myocardial injury in rats,"Sini decoction (SND) is used for cardiovascular disease over thousands of years in China. However, it is still lacking of dose-response relationship of SND in cardiovascular disease at the metabolic level.The present study is designed to explore the cardioprotective effects of different dosages of SND pretreatment on the isoproterenol (ISO)-induced myocardial injury and elucidate the mechanism underlying this protective effect.The cardioprotective effects of different dosages of SND pretreatment on the isoproterenol-induced myocardial injury were compared through a serum metabolomics approach based on ultraperformance liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS). In addition, the cardioprotective effects were evaluated by serum biochemical analysis and histopathological examination of myocardial tissue. Finally, in view of the fact that these perturbed bile acid and phospholipid metabolisms are connected with NF-ÎºB signaling pathway, nuclear expression of NF-ÎºB p65 and the activation of NF-ÎºB were analyzed by immunohistochemistry, immunoblotting and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), respectively.The cardioprotective effect was observed in SND pretreatment groups, especially in low dosage SND group. The results of serum enzyme activities and histopathology were consistent with the above effect. Meanwhile, fifteen latent biomarker candidates were identified involving glucose, phospholipid, bile acid and amino acid metabolisms. Among them, five bile acids including ursodeoxycholic acid, murideoxycholic acid, muricholic acid, hyodeoxycholic acid and cholic acid, were for the first time identified as latent pathological biomarkers related to ISO-induced myocardial injury. Further, different dose SND groups exerted different of inhibition degrees to the activation of NF-ÎºB, which was obvious in the SND-L group.The results revealed that Sini decoction protreatment protects myocardium better at a low dose level and one of possible cardioprotective mechanisms is modulating NF-ÎºB signaling pathway against isoproterenol-induced myocardial injury through regulating phospholipid and bile acid metabolisms.Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier GmbH.

A large number of animal trials each year focus on TCM for DKD, but the evidence for these preclinical studies is not clear.The aim of this study was to study the therapeutic effect of Jiedu Tongluo Baoshen formula (JTBF) on DKD proteinuria and renal protection. At the same time, it is verified that JTBF can reduce podocyte injury by enhancing autophagy function, and then achieve the effect of proteinuria.We use high performance liquid chromatography to detect and analyze the fingerprint of JTBF to find the chemical composition. Subsequently, we constructed a DKD rat model induced by high-fat diet and streptozocin (HFDÂ +Â STZ). Urine and blood biochemical automatic analyzer were used to detect 24-h urine protein quantification (24Â h-UP) and renal function. The renal pathological changes were observed by H&E and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and the levels of autophagy-related proteins and mRNA in podocytes were detected by immunohistochemistry, RT-qPCR and Western Blot. The chemical composition of JTBF was screened from traditional Chinese medicine systems pharmacol (TCMSP) and PubChem databases, and the potential targets and associated pathways of JTBF were predicted using kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis in network pharmacology, and confirmed in animal experiments and histopathological methods.We discovered 77 active ingredients of JTBF. Through animal experiments, it was found that JTBF reduced 24Â h-UP and promoted the expression of podocin, nephrin, and WT-1 in podocytes, thereby reducing podocyte damage. At the same time, JTBF activates the expression of podocyte autophagy-related proteins (beclin-1, LC3 and P62). Subsequently, through network pharmacology predictions, 208 compounds were obtained from JTBF, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/Akt/mTOR) was a potential signal pathway. JTBF was obtained in DKD rat kidney tissue to inhibit the expression of PI3K, Akt and mTOR related proteins.JTBF enhance podocyte autophagy to reduce podocyte damage, thereby effectively treating DKD proteinuria and protecting kidney function.Copyright Â© 2022 Elsevier B.V.

No association was seen for heart attack or diabetes. Fish intake at least weekly was more common in weekly attenders, significantly so only in African American women (odds ratio 1.24, 95% CI 1.01-1.58, p < 0.05) and in older Mexican American men (odds ratio 2.57, 95% CI 1.45-2.57, p < 0.01). In linear regression analyses, no significant independent associations were seen between attendance frequency and serum lipid levels or dietary intake of energy, or fat in g and % of kcal.Hypotheses generated by these analyses are that in African American women stroke is less prevalent and weekly fish intake more prevalent among weekly attenders than others and that there are no significant independent associations of serum lipids, dietary intake, prevalent CHD, or diabetes with frequency of attendance of religious services. Independent testing of these hypotheses in other samples is needed.","Adult, Age Factors, Aged, Animals, Body Mass Index, Cerebral Infarction, Cross-Sectional Studies, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2, Diet Records, Female, Fishes, Food Preferences, Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice, Health Status, Health Surveys, Humans, Lipids, Male, Middle Aged, Myocardial Infarction, Nutrition Assessment, Religion and Medicine, Risk Factors, Statistics as Topic",no,yes,lac,yes,LAaC,17407997.0," Frequency of attendance at religious services, cardiovascular disease, metabolic risk factors and dietary intake in Americans: an age-stratified exploratory analysis ",no,no,yes,Unknown,,False
1694927,Essential hypertension: an insulin-resistant state,"Epidemiological evidence supports a link between hyperinsulinemia and blood pressure. In nondiabetic, normotensive individuals, the male sex, age, obesity, and body fat distribution all are associated with higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure and with higher plasma insulin concentrations. Nevertheless, when accounting for the above physiological variables, blood pressure still is independently related to plasma insulin. In the general population, hypertensive individuals have multiple metabolic abnormalities (glucose intolerance, hyperinsulinemia, and dyslipidemia). A striking pattern of overlap exists among obesity, diabetes, and hypertension. Physiological studies (euglycemic insulin clamp) have shown that essential hypertension per se is a state of insulin resistance: lean, nondiabetic subjects with untreated hypertension have a mean 40% reduction in the ability of physiological hyperinsulinemia to stimulate whole-body glucose uptake. Other insulin actions (suppression of hepatic glucose output, lipolysis, lipid oxidation, and promotion of K+ uptake) are conspicuously preserved. In perfused forearm studies, local (intra-arterial) hyperinsulinemia induces subnormal rates of glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis in the skeletal muscle of individuals with essential hypertension. In the San Antonio Heart Study, parental history of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) is associated with hyperinsulinemia and higher blood pressure and serum lipid levels in nondiabetic probands. In this biethnic population, however, hyperinsulinemia and NIDDM are more prevalent (approximately threefold) among Mexican-Americans than non-Hispanic whites, but hypertension is more prevalent among the latter.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","Blood Pressure, Humans, Hypertension, Insulin, Insulin Resistance",no,no,lac,yes,LAaC,1694927.0, Essential hypertension: an insulin-resistant state ,no,yes,yes,Unknown,,False
14580165,Common variants in the lipoprotein lipase gene in Brazil: association with lipids and angiographically assessed coronary atherosclerosis,"Lipoprotein lipase is the rate-limiting enzyme in the lipolysis of plasma triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. We studied six variants (T-93G, D9N, N291S, PvuII, HindIII and S447X) in the lipoprotein lipase (LPL) gene in 309 non-diabetic patients with angiographically assessed coronary artery disease and in 197 controls in a southern Brazilian population of European descent. The HindIII H-allele was associated with lower triglycerides (p < 0.01) and higher high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p = 0.03) levels, and the S447X mutation was associated with lower triglyceride levels (p < 0.01) in males, but not females. No other significant lipid associations were observed. Haplotypes were derived from these two sites (HindIII/S447X), and carriers of H-S and H-X haplotypes showed lower triglycerides (p < 0.01) and increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p = 0.01) levels when compared to the H+S haplotype in males. In this gender, the H-X haplotype was associated with a protective effect (OR = 0.36, 95%CI = 0.13-0.97) for significant disease (> or = 60% of luminal coronary stenosis), even controlling for other classical risk factors.","Aged, Brazil, Coronary Angiography, Coronary Artery Disease, Female, Genetics, Population, Genotype, Humans, Linkage Disequilibrium, Lipid Metabolism, Lipoprotein Lipase, Male, Middle Aged, Mutation, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",yes,yes,lac,yes,LAaC,14580165.0, Common variants in the lipoprotein lipase gene in Brazil: association with lipids and angiographically assessed coronary atherosclerosis ,yes,no,yes,we,,False
11756346,SNP43 of CAPN10 and the risk of type 2 Diabetes in African-Americans: the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study,"Recently, an A-to-G variant in intron 3 (SNP43) of the calcium-activated neutral protease 10 gene (CAPN10) was identified as a possible type 2 diabetes susceptibility gene through positional cloning in Mexican-Americans. We conducted cross-sectional and prospective studies to evaluate the relation between SNP43 and type 2 diabetes and related traits in middle-aged African-American participants of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study, a population-based longitudinal study. At baseline, 269 prevalent diabetes cases and 1,159 nondiabetic control subjects were studied. Those with the G/G genotype were more likely to have diabetes than those with the A/G or A/A genotype (odds ratio [OR] 1.41, 95% CI 1.00-1.99, P = 0.05). In the prospective study, 166 of the control subjects developed incident diabetes over 9 years of follow-up. The incidence of diabetes for individuals with the G/G genotype did not differ significantly from those with at least one copy of the A allele (23.3 vs. 19.5 per 1,000 person years, P = 0.29). Pooling prevalent and incident diabetic cases together, individuals with the G/G genotype were approximately 40% more likely to have diabetes than those without (OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.04-1.83, P = 0.03). Because of the high frequency of the G allele (0.88), approximately 25% of the susceptibility to type 2 diabetes in African-Americans may be attributed to the G/G genotype at SNP43 of CAPN10, although most of the subjects with the G/G genotype did not develop diabetes over the 9 years of follow-up. We conclude from this large prospective study that the G allele of SNP43 of CAPN10 or another allele or gene that is in linkage disequilibrium with it increases susceptibility to type 2 diabetes in African-Americans.","Arteriosclerosis, Black People, Blood Glucose, Blood Pressure, Calpain, Cholesterol, HDL, Cholesterol, LDL, Cross-Sectional Studies, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2, Female, Genetic Variation, Genotype, Humans, Incidence, Insulin, Introns, Male, Middle Aged, Prediabetic State, Prevalence, Risk Factors, Socioeconomic Factors, Triglycerides, United States",yes,yes,lac,yes,LAaC,11756346.0, SNP43 of CAPN10 and the risk of type 2 Diabetes in African-Americans ,yes,yes,yes,Unknown,,False

A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the variation in different ethnic groups may help to elucidate the pathophysiology of T2DM. The present work aims to generate a hypothesis regarding ""why do subjects with African background have excess burden of T2DM?"".In the current study, we performed metabolite profiling of plasma samples derived from 773 subjects of three ethnic groups (Dutch with European, Ghanaian and African Surinamese background). We performed Bayesian lognormal regression analyses to assess associations between HbA1c and circulating metabolites.Here we show that subjects with African Surinamese and Ghanaian background had similar associations of HbA1c with circulating amino acids and triglyceride-rich lipoproteins as subjects with European background. In contrast, subjects with Ghanaian and African Surinamese background had different associations of HbA1c with acetoacetate, small LDL particle and small HDL particle concentrations, compared to the subjects with European background.On the basis of the observations, we hypothesize that the excess burden of T2DM in subjects with African background may be due to impaired cholesterol efflux capacity or abnormal cholesterol uptake.","Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Black People, Blood Glucose, Cholesterol, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2, Female, Glycated Hemoglobin, Humans, Lipoproteins, Male, Metabolome, Middle Aged, Netherlands, White People, Young Adult",yes,yes,lac,yes,LAaC,31040268.0," Association of hemoglobin A1C with circulating metabolites in Dutch with European, African Surinamese and Ghanaian background ",yes,yes,yes,"ssa, we",,False
24637191,A Petiveria alliacea standardized fraction induces breast adenocarcinoma cell death by modulating glycolytic metabolism,"Folk medicine uses aqueous and alcoholic extracts from Petiveria alliacea (Phytolaccaceae) in leukemia and breast cancer treatment in the Caribbean, Central and South America. Herein, we validated the biological activity of a Petiveria alliacea fraction using a metastatic breast adenocarcinoma model (4T1).Petiveria alliacea fraction biological activity was determined estimating cell proliferation, cell colony growth capacity and apoptosis (caspase-3 activity, DNA fragmentation and mitochondrial membrane potential) in 4T1 cells. Petiveria alliacea was used at ICâ‚…â‚€ concentration (29 Âµg/mL) and 2 dilutions below, doxorubicin at 0.27 Âµg/mL (positive control) and dibenzyl disulfide at 2.93 Âµg/mL (IC50 fraction marker compound). Proteomic estimations were analyzed by LC-MS-MS. Protein level expression was confirmed by RT-PCR. Glucose and lactate levels were measured by enzymatic assays. LD50 was established in BALB/c mice and antitumoral activity evaluated in mice transplanted with GFP-tagged 4T1 cells. Mice were treated with Petiveria alliacea fraction via I.P (182 mg/kg corresponding to 1/8 of LDâ‚…â‚€ and 2 dilutions below).Petiveria alliacea fraction in vitro induces 4T1 cells apoptosis, caspase-3 activation, DNA fragmentation without mitochondria membrane depolarization, and decreases cell colony growth capacity. Also, changes in glycolytic enzymes expression cause a decrease in glucose uptake and lactate production. Fraction also promotes breast primary tumor regression in BALB/c mice transplanted with GFP-tagged 4T1 cells.A fraction of Petiveria alliacea leaves and stems induces in vitro cell death and in vivo tumor regression in a murine breast cancer model. Our results validate in partly, the traditional use of Petiveria alliacea in breast cancer treatment, revealing a new way of envisioning Petiveria alliacea biological activity.

27625997,Gut Microbiota: A Contributing Factor to Obesity,"Obesity, a global epidemic of the modern era, is a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and diabetes. The pervasiveness of obesity and overweight in both developed as well as developing populations is on the rise and placing a huge burden on health and economic resources. Consequently, research to control this emerging epidemic is of utmost importance. Recently, host interactions with their resident gut microbiota (GM) have been reported to be involved in the pathogenesis of many metabolic diseases, including obesity, diabetes, and CVD. Around 10(14) microorganisms reside within the lower human intestine and many of these 10(14) microorganisms have developed mutualistic or commensal associations with the host and actively involved in many physiological processes of the host. However, dysbiosis (altered gut microbial composition) with other predisposing genetic and environmental factors, may contribute to host metabolic disorders resulting in many ailments. Therefore, delineating the role of GM as a contributing factor to obesity is the main objective of this review. Obesity research, as a field is expanding rapidly due to major advances in nutrigenomics, metabolomics, RNA silencing, epigenetics, and other disciplines that may result in the emergence of new technologies and methods to better interpret causal relationships between microbiota and obesity.","Animals, Dysbiosis, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Gastrointestinal Tract, Humans, Obesity",yes,no,mena,no,MEaNA,27625997.0, Gut Microbiota: A Contributing Factor to Obesity ,no,no,no,Unknown,,False
22494106,The effects of high-intensity resistance exercise on the blood lipid profile and liver function in hypercholesterolemic hamsters,"It is well established that atherogenic dyslipidemia, characterized by high levels of triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, constitutes important risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Regular exercise has been associated with a reduced risk for metabolic diseases. However, studies supporting the concept that resistance exercise is a modifier of blood lipid parameters are often contradictory. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of high-intensity resistance exercise on the serum levels of TG, TC, HDL and non-HDL cholesterol, glucose, and the liver function enzymes alanine aminotransferase (ALT, EC 2.6.1.2) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST, EC 2.6.1.1) in golden Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus (Waterhouse, 1839)) fed a hypercholesterolemic diet. Sedentary groups (S) and exercise groups (E) were fed a standard diet (SS and ES) or a cholesterol-enriched diet (standard plus 1% cholesterol, SC and EC). Resistance exercise was performed by jumps in the water, carrying a load strapped to the chest, representing 10 maximum repetitions (10 RM, 30 s rest, five days per week for five weeks). Mean blood sample comparisons were made by ANOVA + Tukey or ANOVA + Kruskal-Wallis tests (p < 0.05) to compare parametric and nonparametric samples, respectively. There were no differences in blood lipids between the standard diet groups (SS and ES) (p > 0.05). However, the EC group increased the glucose, non-HDL, and TC levels in comparison with the ES group. Moreover, the EC group increased the TG levels versus the SC group (p < 0.05). In addition, the ALT levels were increased only by diet treatment. These findings indicated that high-intensity resistance exercise contributed to dyslipidemia in hamsters fed a hypercholesterolemic diet, whereas liver function enzymes did not differ in regards to the exercise protocol.","Alanine Transaminase, Analysis of Variance, Animals, Aspartate Aminotransferases, Blood Glucose, Cholesterol, Cricetinae, Diet, Hypercholesterolemia, Lipids, Lipoproteins, HDL, Lipoproteins, LDL, Liver, Liver Function Tests, Male, Physical Conditioning, Animal, Physical Exertion, Risk Factors, Statistics, Nonparametric",no,no,Unknown,yes,MEaNA,22494106.0, The effects of high-intensity resistance exercise on the blood lipid profile and liver function in hypercholesterolemic hamsters ,no,no,no,none,,False

Individuals with PTSD also have increased co-morbidity with several serious medical conditions, including autoimmune diseases, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes, raising the possibility that systemic pathology associated with PTSD might be identified by metabolomic analysis of blood. We sought to identify metabolites that are altered in male combat veterans with PTSD. In this case-control study, we compared metabolomic profiles from age-matched male combat trauma-exposed veterans from the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts with PTSD (n = 52) and without PTSD (n = 51) ('Discovery group'). An additional group of 31 PTSD-positive and 31 PTSD-negative male combat-exposed veterans was used for validation of these findings ('Test group'). Plasma metabolite profiles were measured in all subjects using ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. We identified key differences between PTSD subjects and controls in pathways related to glycolysis and fatty acid uptake and metabolism in the initial 'Discovery group', consistent with mitochondrial alterations or dysfunction, which were also confirmed in the 'Test group'. Other pathways related to urea cycle and amino acid metabolism were different between PTSD subjects and controls in the 'Discovery' but not in the smaller 'Test' group. These metabolic differences were not explained by comorbid major depression, body mass index, blood glucose, hemoglobin A1c, smoking, or use of analgesics, antidepressants, statins, or anti-inflammatories. These data show replicable, wide-ranging changes in the metabolic profile of combat-exposed males with PTSD, with a suggestion of mitochondrial alterations or dysfunction, that may contribute to the behavioral and somatic phenotypes associated with this disease.","Adult, Body Mass Index, Carbohydrates, Case-Control Studies, Fatty Acids, Glycated Hemoglobin, Humans, Hypoxanthine, Lipids, Male, Metabolomics, Mitochondria, Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic, Veterans",yes,no,mena,yes,MEaNA,30883584.0, Metabolomic analysis of male combat veterans with post traumatic stress disorder ,yes,no,yes,Unknown,,False
17496356,New frontiers in the management of type 2 diabetes,"Type 2 diabetes is a chronic, debilitating disease characterized by insulin resistance, impaired insulin secretion, and hyperglycaemia, and afflicting at least 171 million people worldwide (31.7 million in India). This chronic disease is not benign and patients with diabetes suffer from numerous microvascular and macrovascular complications which cause a lot of morbidity and mortality. Results from the UKPDS (United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study) clearly demonstrate that tight glucose and blood pressure control in patients with type 2 diabetes prevents the development of and delays the progression of microvascular complications and possibly macrovascular disease. In addition, results from the UKPDS and other studies like the Heart Protection Study (HPS) have also shown that treatment of concomitant risk factors like lipids and blood pressure and the use of aspirin have favourable effects on cardiovascular complications and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes. In order to achieve glycaemic goals, we have several anti-hyperglycaemic agents in our therapeutic armamentarium today. However, despite their availability, we have not been able to achieve glycaemic goals in our patients with diabetes due to a variety of reasons. However, there appears to be hope for the future. The progress of research in all fields of diabetes therapeutics from diabetes treatment to continuous glucose monitoring systems to novel insulin delivery systems has been spectacular. These advances have resulted in newer pharmacologic agents, implantable glucose sensors and inhaled insulin. There is also hope that large scale implementation of intensive lifestyle programmes and education efforts may help to prevent diabetes in high risk individuals. Indeed, the repertoire of options and strategies currently available (and in the pipeline) to treat and prevent/delay diabetes and its complications is impressive. In this review, we will discuss the evolving cardiovascular benefits of the thiazolidinediones (TZDs); describe in detail the newer glucose lowering gut hormones with novel mechanisms of action; delineate the recent advances in non invasive insulin delivery systems (including inhaled insulin); review the ongoing developments in continuous glucose measuring devices and finally present an update on the prevention of diabetes.","Administration, Inhalation, Blood Glucose, Blood Glucose Self-Monitoring, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2, Diabetic Angiopathies, Humans, Hypoglycemic Agents, Insulin, Thiazolidinediones",no,yes,we,no,SA,17496356.0, New frontiers in the management of type 2 diabetes ,no,yes,no,sa,,False

11122781,Diabetes and cardiovascular disease,"Hypoglycaemia has long been recognised as a dangerous side-effect of treatment of diabetes with insulin or insulin secretagogues. With its potential to disrupt cerebral function, hypoglycaemia can have a major effect on peoples' lives. Study findings have suggested that hypoglycaemia is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events and mortality. Different mechanisms by which hypoglycaemia might provoke cardiovascular events have been identified in experimental studies, and in clinical studies cardiac arrhythmias have been reported to be induced by hypoglycaemia, with one report describing sudden death during a severe episode. Emerging evidence suggests that the association between hypoglycaemia and cardiovascular events and mortality is likely to be multifactorial. The association is probably partly caused by confounding, with hypoglycaemia occurring more frequently in people with comorbidities who are also more likely to die than those without. However, people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes also seem at risk of hypoglycaemia-induced cardiovascular effects. This risk should be recognised by clinicians when agreeing glycaemic goals with patients and choosing appropriate glucose-lowering therapies._x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_

32460589,"Effect of Gymnema sylvestre Administration on Glycemic Control, Insulin Secretion, and Insulin Sensitivity in Patients with Impaired Glucose Tolerance","Gymnema sylvestre, a plant typical of India, has long been known for its hypoglycemic effects. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of G. sylvestre administration on glycemic control, insulin secretion, and insulin sensitivity in patients with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted in 30 patients with IGT. Fifteen patients randomly received G. sylvestre in doses of 300 mg b.i.d. and the other 15 received placebo in the same way. Before and after the intervention, anthropometric and metabolic measurements were taken, including 2-h oral glucose tolerance test (2-h OGTT), fasting plasma glucose, glycated hemoglobin A1c (A1C), and the lipid profile panel. Areas under the curve of glucose and insulin were calculated, as well as the insulinogenic, Stumvoll, and Matsuda indices. Wilcoxon, Mann-Whitney U, and chi-square or Fisher's exact tests were performed, and a P-value â‰¤.05 was considered statistically significant. There was a significant reduction in 2-h OGTT (9.1 Â± 1.2 vs. 7.8 Â± 1.7 mmol/L, P = .003), A1C (5.8 Â± 0.3% vs. 5.4 Â± 0.4%, P = .025), body weight, body mass index, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in the G. sylvestre group, with an increment in the Matsuda index (1.8 Â± 0.8 vs. 2.4 Â± 1.2, P = .008). At the end of the intervention, 46.7% of the patients obtained normal values in A1C. In conclusion, G. sylvestre administration in patients with IGT decreased 2-h OGTT and A1C, increasing insulin sensitivity.

31140389,The influence of maternal and infant nutrition on cardiometabolic traits: novel findings and future research directions from four Canadian birth cohort studies,"A mother's nutritional choices while pregnant may have a great influence on her baby's development in the womb and during infancy. There is evidence that what a mother eats during pregnancy interacts with her genes to affect her child's susceptibility to poor health outcomes including childhood obesity, pre-diabetes, allergy and asthma. Furthermore, after what an infant eats can change his or her intestinal bacteria, which can further influence the development of these poor outcomes. In the present paper, we review the importance of birth cohorts, the formation and early findings from a multi-ethnic birth cohort alliance in Canada and summarise our future research directions for this birth cohort alliance. We summarise a method for harmonising collection and analysis of self-reported dietary data across multiple cohorts and provide examples of how this birth cohort alliance has contributed to our understanding of gestational diabetes risk; ethnic and diet-influences differences in the healthy infant microbiome; and the interplay between diet, ethnicity and birth weight. Ongoing work in this birth cohort alliance will focus on the use of metabolomic profiling to measure dietary intake, discovery of unique diet-gene and diet-epigenome interactions, and qualitative interviews with families of children at risk of metabolic syndrome. Our findings to-date and future areas of research will advance the evidence base that informs dietary guidelines in pregnancy, infancy and childhood, and will be relevant to diverse and high-risk populations of Canada and other high-income countries._x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_

11487308,Regular ingestion of opuntia robusta lowers oxidation injury,"The influence of opuntia robusta (prickly pear), a traditionally used dietary nutrient against diabetes mellitus among the American Indian population, was examined in 15 young patients suffering from familial heterozygous isolated hypercholesterolemia. Oxidation injury was determined via 8-epi-PGF(2 alpha)in plasma, serum and urine. Daily consumption of 250 g broiled edible pulp of prickly pear had no influence on body weight and body fat composition. Total cholesterol was lowered (P<0.01) as was LDL-cholesterol (P<0.04). No significant changes were observed either in triglycerides or in HDL. Prickly pear induced a significant decrease in plasma (27.9+/-3.3-->25.6+/-3.2;P<0.03), serum (302.0+/-11.4-->283.2+/-14.5;P<0.0003) and urinary (355.9+/-18.4-->323.9+/-16;P<0.00002) 8-epi-PGF(2alpha)values. The findings on a decrease of 8-epi-PGF(2alpha)were more pronounced in females than in males, the highest significance being found in urine, while, in contrast, the effects on total- and LDL-cholesterol were more pronounced in males. A prerunning 4 weeks period of dietary counseling had no significant effect on either of the parameters examined. These findings indicate that the regular ingestion of opuntia robusta is able to significantly reduce in-vivo oxidation injury in a group of patients suffering from familial hypercholesterolemia.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether variation in SIRT1 affects susceptibility to obesity or type 2 diabetes in Pima Indians, a population with very high prevalence and incidence rates of these diseases. Genotypic data from single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified by sequencing regions of SIRT1 combined with SNPs in/near SIRT1 from a prior genome-wide association study determined that 4 tag SNPs (rs7895833, rs10509291, rs7896005, and rs4746720) could capture information across this gene and its adjacent 5' region. The tag SNPs were genotyped in a population-based sample of 3501 Pima Indians (44% had diabetes, 58% female) for association with type 2 diabetes and BMI. Metabolic trait data and adipose biopsies were available on a subset of these subjects. Two tag SNPs, rs10509291 and rs7896005, were nominally associated with type 2 diabetes (P=0.01, OR=1.25 95%CI 1.05-1.48, and P=0.02, OR=1.17 95%CI 1.02-1.34, respectively; additive P values adjusted for age, sex, birth year, and family membership), but not BMI (adjusted P values 0.52 and 0.45, respectively). Among metabolically characterized subjects with normal glucose tolerance (N=243), those carrying the diabetes risk allele (T) for rs10509291 and (G) for rs7896005 had a reduced acute insulin response (AIR) to an intravenous glucose bolus (adjusted P=0.045 and 0.035, respectively). SIRT1 expression in adipose biopsies was negatively correlated with BMI (adjusted P=0.00001).

Of the nine variants where we observed significant heterogeneity of effect by racial/ethnic group (P(heterogeneity) < 0.05), eight were positively associated with risk (OR >1) in at least five groups. The marked directional consistency of association observed for most genetic variants across populations implies a shared functional common variant in each region. Fine-mapping of all loci will be required to reveal markers of risk that are important within and across populations.","Adult, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Alleles, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2, Female, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, Genome-Wide Association Study, Genotype, Humans, Male, Metagenomics, Middle Aged, Population Groups, Risk, Risk Factors",yes,yes,"we, na, lac, ea, seap",yes,SA,22474029.0, Consistent directions of effect for established type 2 diabetes risk variants across populations: the population architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) Consortium ,yes,yes,yes,Unknown,,False

22810975,Variants in the LEPR gene are nominally associated with higher BMI and lower 24-h energy expenditure in Pima Indians,"Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have been used to search for susceptibility genes for type 2 diabetes and obesity in the Pima Indians, a population with a high prevalence of both diseases. In these studies, a variant (rs2025804) in the LEPR gene was nominally associated with BMI in 1,082 subjects (P = 0.03 adjusted for age, sex, birth year, and family membership). Therefore the LEPR and leptin overlapping transcript (LEPROT) genes were selected for further sequencing and genotyping in larger population-based samples for association analyses with obesity-related phenotypes. Selected variants (n = 80) spanning these genes were genotyped in a sample of full-heritage Pima Indians (n = 2,842) and several common variants including rs2025804 were nominally associated with BMI (P = 0.05-0.003 adjusted for age, sex, birth year, and family membership). Four common tag variants associated with BMI in the full-heritage Pima Indian sample were genotyped in a second sample of mixed-heritage Native Americans (n = 2,969) and three of the variants showed nominal replication (P = 0.03-0.006 adjusted as above and additionally for Indian heritage). Combining both samples provided the strongest evidence for association (adjusted P = 0.0003-0.0001). A subset of these individuals (n = 403) had been metabolically characterized for predictors of obesity and the BMI risk alleles for the variants tagged by rs2025804 were also associated with lower 24-h energy expenditure (24hEE) as assessed in a human respiratory chamber (P = 0.0007 adjusted for age, sex, fat mass, fat-free mass, activity, and family membership). We conclude that common noncoding variation in the LEPR gene is associated with higher BMI and lower energy expenditure in Native Americans.","Body Mass Index, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2, Energy Metabolism, Female, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, Genome-Wide Association Study, Genotype, Humans, Indians, North American, Male, Obesity, Phenotype, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide, Postprandial Period, Receptors, Leptin, Thermogenesis",yes,yes,unk,yes,SA,22810975.0, Variants in the LEPR gene are nominally associated with higher BMI and lower 24-h energy expenditure in Pima Indians ,yes,no,yes,Unknown,,False
12643210,Genetics of diabetic nephropathy in the Pima Indians,"Diabetic nephropathy is the leading cause of renal failure in industrialized countries. There is strong evidence that diabetic nephropathy is influenced by genetic factors. Studies in the Pima Indians as well as in other populations demonstrate that diabetic nephropathy aggregates in families. The hypothesis that the familial aggregation reflects the effect of a major gene was formally tested by segregation analysis of diabetic nephropathy in Pima Indians with type 2 diabetes. The segregation analysis provided strong evidence for a major genetic effect on the prevalence of diabetic nephropathy; this suggests that some of the genetic determinants of diabetic nephropathy may have effects of sufficient magnitude to be detected by linkage analysis. Therefore, we analyzed data from a genome-wide scan to identify susceptibility loci for nephropathy in diabetic Pima Indians. Analyses conducted by both parametric (model-based) and nonparametric methods revealed tentative evidence for nephropathy susceptibility loci on chromosomes 3q, 7q, 18q, and 20p.","Diabetic Nephropathies, Humans, Indians, North American",yes,yes,unk,no,SA,12643210.0, Genetics of diabetic nephropathy in the Pima Indians ,yes,yes,yes,Unknown,,False

35484507,Applications of Bayesian shrinkage prior models in clinical research with categorical responses,"Background: Prediction and classification algorithms are commonly used in clinical research for identifying patients susceptible to clinical conditions such as diabetes, colon cancer, and Alzheimer's disease. Developing accurate prediction and classification methods benefits personalized medicine. Building an excellent predictive model involves selecting the features that are most significantly associated with the outcome. These features can include several biological and demographic characteristics, such as genomic biomarkers and health history. Such variable selection becomes challenging when the number of potential predictors is large. Bayesian shrinkage models have emerged as popular and flexible methods of variable selection in regression settings. This work discusses variable selection with three shrinkage priors and illustrates its application to clinical data such as Pima Indians Diabetes, Colon cancer, ADNI, and OASIS Alzheimer's real-world data._x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_

Methods: A unified Bayesian hierarchical framework that implements and compares shrinkage priors in binary and multinomial logistic regression models is presented. The key feature is the representation of the likelihood by a Polya-Gamma data augmentation, which admits a natural integration with a family of shrinkage priors, specifically focusing on Horseshoe, Dirichlet Laplace, and Double Pareto priors. Extensive simulation studies are conducted to assess the performances under different data dimensions and parameter settings.

9126490,Genetic analysis of human type 1 protein phosphatase inhibitor 2 in insulin-resistant Pima Indians,"The rate-limiting enzyme in insulin-mediated nonoxidative glucose disposal, glycogen synthase, has reduced activity in insulin-resistant subjects at risk for developing non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). The synthase-activating enzyme, type 1 protein phosphatase (PP1), also has an abnormally low level of activity. Inhibitor 2 (I-2) reversibly inhibits and facilitates the proper conformation of free catalytic subunits of PP1. This study investigates whether genetic alteration(s) in the I-2 coding locus (PPP1R2) could contribute to insulin resistance in Pima Indians. We determined that the authentic PPP1R2 gene is located on chromosome 3q29 and consists of six exons. The previously reported homologue of PPP1R2 on chromosome 5 is identified as an intronless pseudogene. Comparative sequencing of PPP1R2 exons and splice junctions revealed no mutations in insulin-resistant Pima Indians. The information on the genomic structure of PPP1R2 is important for exploring this gene as a potential candidate contributing to insulin resistance and NIDDM in other populations.","Amino Acid Sequence, Base Sequence, Chromosome Mapping, Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3, Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5, DNA Primers, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2, Enzyme Inhibitors, Exons, Humans, Indians, North American, Insulin Resistance, Introns, Molecular Sequence Data, Phosphoprotein Phosphatases, Proteins, Pseudogenes",yes,yes,unk,yes,SA,9126490.0, Genetic analysis of human type 1 protein phosphatase inhibitor 2 in insulin-resistant Pima Indians ,yes,yes,yes,Unknown,,False
32728124,DNA methylation and adiposity phenotypes: an epigenome-wide association study among adults in the Strong Heart Study,"Elevated adiposity is often posited by medical and public health researchers to be a risk factor associated with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and other diseases. These health challenges are now thought to be reflected in epigenetic modifications to DNA molecules, such as DNA methylation, which can alter gene expression.Here we report the results of three Epigenome Wide Association Studies (EWAS) in which we assessed the differential methylation of DNA (obtained from peripheral blood) associated with three adiposity phenotypes (BMI, waist circumference, and impedance-measured percent body fat) among American Indian adult participants in the Strong Heart Study.We found differential methylation at 8264 CpG sites associated with at least one of our three response variables. Of the three adiposity proxies we measured, waist circumference had the highest number of associated differentially methylated CpGs, while percent body fat was associated with the lowest. Because both waist circumference and percent body fat relate to physiology, we focused interpretations on these variables. We found a low degree of overlap between these two variables in our gene ontology enrichment and Differentially Methylated Region analyses, supporting that waist circumference and percent body fat measurements represent biologically distinct concepts.We interpret these general findings to indicate that highly significant regions of the genome (DMR) and synthesis pathways (GO) in waist circumference analyses are more likely to be associated with the presence of visceral/abdominal fat than more general measures of adiposity. Our findings confirmed numerous CpG sites previously found to be differentially methylated in association with adiposity phenotypes, while we also found new differentially methylated CpG sites and regions not previously identified.","Adiposity, Aged, American Indian or Alaska Native, Body Mass Index, CpG Islands, DNA Methylation, Epigenome, Female, Gene Ontology, Genome-Wide Association Study, Heart Disease Risk Factors, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Phenotype, Prospective Studies, Waist Circumference",yes,yes,unk,yes,SA,32728124.0, DNA methylation and adiposity phenotypes: an epigenome-wide association study among adults in the Strong Heart Study ,yes,no,yes,Unknown,,False
21299892,Bimodal distribution of RNA expression levels in human skeletal muscle tissue,"Many human diseases and phenotypes are related to RNA expression, levels of which are influenced by a wide spectrum of genetic and exposure-related factors. In a large genome-wide study of muscle tissue expression, we found that some genes exhibited a bimodal distribution of RNA expression, in contrast to what is usually assumed in studies of a single healthy tissue. As bimodality has classically been considered a hallmark of genetic control, we assessed the genome-wide prevalence, cause, and association of this phenomenon with diabetes-related phenotypes in skeletal muscle tissue from 225 healthy Pima Indians using exon array expression chips.Two independent batches of microarrays were used for bimodal assessment and comparison. Of the 17,881 genes analyzed, eight (GSTM1, HLA-DRB1, ERAP2, HLA-DRB5, MAOA, ACTN3, NR4A2, and THNSL2) were found to have bimodal expression replicated in the separate batch groups, while 24 other genes had evidence of bimodality in only one group. Some bimodally expressed genes had modest associations with pre-diabetic phenotypes, of note ACTN3 with insulin resistance. Most of the other bimodal genes have been reported to be involved with various other diseases and characteristics. Association of expression with cis genetic variation in a subset of 149 individuals found all but one of the confirmed bimodal genes and nearly half of all potential ones to be highly significant expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL). The rare prevalence of these bimodally expressed genes found after controlling for batch effects was much lower than the prevalence reported in other studies. Additional validation in data from separate muscle expression studies confirmed the low prevalence of bimodality we observed.We conclude that the prevalence of bimodal gene expression is quite rare in healthy muscle tissue (<0.2%), and is much lower than limited reports from other studies. The major cause of these clearly bimodal expression patterns in homogeneous tissue appears to be cis-polymorphisms, indicating that such bimodal genes are, for the most part, eQTL. The high frequency of disease associations reported with these genes gives hope that this unique feature may identify or actually be an underlying factor responsible for disease development.","Actinin, Aminopeptidases, DNA Copy Number Variations, Glutathione Transferase, HLA-DR Antigens, HLA-DRB1 Chains, HLA-DRB5 Chains, Humans, In Vitro Techniques, Monoamine Oxidase, Muscle, Skeletal, Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 4, Group A, Member 2, Phenotype, Quantitative Trait Loci, RNA, Ribosomal",yes,yes,unk,yes,SA,21299892.0, Bimodal distribution of RNA expression levels in human skeletal muscle tissue ,yes,yes,yes,Unknown,,False

Pima Diabetes Gene Group,"On the basis of accumulating evidence that obesity has a substantial genetic component, a genomewide search for linkages of DNA markers to percent body fat is ongoing in Pima Indians, a population with a very high prevalence of obesity. An initial screen of the genome (>600 markers in 874 individuals) has been completed using highly polymorphic markers (mean heterozygosity = .67). Reported here are the sib-pair linkage results for percent body fat (277 siblings), the best available indicator of overall obesity. Single-marker linkages to percent body fat were evaluated by sib-pair analysis for quantitative traits. From these analyses, the best evidence of genes influencing body fat came from markers at chromosome 11q21-q22 and 3p24.2-p22 (P = .001; LOD = 2.0).

We conducted a prospective study of primary care patients with urinary tract infection (UTI) symptoms and culture-confirmed UTI in Singapore from 2015 to 2016. Cohort characteristics and antimicrobial susceptibility of cultured isolates were analyzed. Among Enterobacteriaceae isolates, early symptom resolution (within 3â€‰days) according to antibiotic prescribed and isolate susceptibility and factors associated with antibiotic resistance were evaluated. Of 695 symptomatic patients, 299 were urine culture positive; of these 299 patients, 259 (87%) were female. Escherichia coli was the most common uropathogen (76%). Enterobacteriaceae isolates (nâ€‰=â€‰283) were highly susceptible to amoxicillin-clavulanate (86%), nitrofurantoin (87%), and fosfomycin (98%), but >20% were resistant to ciprofloxacin and co-trimoxazole. Isolates resistant to appropriate indicator antibiotics were further tested to determine proportions positive for blaCTX-M (14/26, 54%), plasmid-mediated ampC (12/24, 50%), qnr (7/69, 10%), and fos (1/6, 17%) resistance genes.

34760721,Host Response to SARS-CoV2 and Emerging Variants in Pre-Existing Liver and Gastrointestinal Diseases,"Novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2 is evolving continuously with emergence of several variants of increasing transmission capabilities and pandemic potential. Generation of variants occurs through accumulation of mutations due to the RNA nature of viral genome, which is further enhanced by variable selection pressures of this ongoing pandemic. COVID-19 presentations of SARS-CoV2 are mainly pulmonary manifestations with or without mild gastrointestinal (GI) and hepatic symptoms. However, the virus has evolved beyond pulmonary manifestations to multisystem disorder due to systemic inflammation and cytokine storm. Definitive cause of acute or late onset of inflammation, infection in various organs, and host response to emerging variants lacks clarity and needs elucidation. Several studies have reported underlying diseases including diabetes, hypertension, obesity, cardio- and cerebrovascular disorders, and immunocompromised conditions as significant risk factors for severe form of COVID-19. Pre-existing liver and GI diseases are also highly predominant in the population, which can alter COVID-19 outcome due to altered immune status and host response. We aim to review the emerging variants of SARS-CoV2 and host response in patients with pre-existing liver and GI diseases.In this review, we have elucidated the emergence and characteristic features of new SARS-CoV2 variants, mechanisms of infection and host immune response, GI and hepatic manifestation with radiologic features of COVID-19, and outcomes in pre-existing liver and GI diseases.Emerging variants of concern (VOC) have shown increased transmissibility and virulence with severe COVID-19 presentation and mortality. There is a drastic swift of variants from the first wave to the next wave of infections with predominated major VOC including alpha (B.1.1.7, UK), beta (B.1.351, South Africa), gamma (B.1.1.28.1, Brazil), and delta (B1.1.617, India) variants. The mutations in the spike protein of VOC are implicated for increased receptor binding (N501Y, P681R) and immune escape (L452R, E484K/Q, T478K/R) to host response. Pre-existing liver and GI diseases not only have altered tissue expression and distribution of viral entry ACE2 receptor but also host protease TMPRSS2, which is required for both spike protein binding and cleavage to initiate infection. Altered immune status due to pre-existing conditions results in delayed virus clearance or prolonged viremia. Even though GI and hepatic manifestations of SARS-CoV2 are less severe, the detection of virus in patient's stool indicates GI tropism, replication, and shedding from the GI tract. COVID-19-induced liver injury, acute hepatic decompensation, and incidences of acute-on-chronic liver failure may change the disease outcomes.The changes in the spike protein of emerging variants, immunomodulation by viral proteins, and altered expression of host viral entry receptor in pre-existing diseases are the key determinants of host response to SARS-CoV2 and its disease outcome.Copyright Â© 2021 Nayak, Lal, Kumar, Das, Saraya and Shalimar.",,yes,no,sa,no,SA,34760721.0, Host Response to SARS-CoV2 and Emerging Variants in Pre-Existing Liver and Gastrointestinal Diseases ,no,no,no,Unknown,,False

In a parallel study, serum samples from 28 American Indians with type 2 diabetes from the Gila River Indian Community, including 12 without DR, 7 with mild nonproliferative DR (NPDR), and 9 with moderate NPDR, were selected. A mass-spectrometry-based lipidomic platform was used to measure serum and tissue lipids.RESULTSIn the postmortem retinas, we found a graded decrease of long-chain acylcarnitines and longer-chain fatty acid ester of hydroxyl fatty acids, diacylglycerols, triacylglycerols, phosphatidylcholines, and ceramide(NS) in central retina from individuals with no diabetes to those with diabetes with DR. The American Indians' sera also exhibited a graded decrease in circulating long-chain acylcarnitines and a graded increase in the intermediate-length saturated and monounsaturated triacylglycerols from no DR to moderate NPDR.CONCLUSIONThese findings suggest diminished synthesis of complex lipids and impaired mitochondrial Î²-oxidation of fatty acids in retinal DR, with parallel changes in circulating lipids.TRIAL REGISTRATIONClinicalTrials.gov NCT00340678.FUNDINGThis work was supported by NIH grants R24 DK082841, K08DK106523, R03DK121941, P30DK089503, P30DK081943, P30DK020572, P30 EY007003; The Thomas Beatson Foundation; and JDRF Center for Excellence (5-COE-2019-861-S-B).","Adult, Aged, American Indian or Alaska Native, Arizona, Black or African American, Carnitine, Case-Control Studies, Ceramides, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2, Diabetic Retinopathy, Diglycerides, Disease Progression, Esters, Female, Hispanic or Latino, Humans, Lipidomics, Male, Mass Spectrometry, Middle Aged, Mitochondria, Phosphatidylcholines, Retina, Triglycerides, White People",no,yes,unk,yes,SA,34437304.0, Diminished retinal complex lipid synthesis and impaired fatty acid beta-oxidation associated with human diabetic retinopathy ,yes,yes,yes,Unknown,,False

Results: Twelve of the 21 SNPs analysed had a significant association with HDL-C in Pima Indians; five SNPs representing four loci (CETP, DOCK6, PPP1R3B and ABCA1) reached genome-wide significance. Three SNPs, at CETP, KLF14 and HNF4A, associated with type 2 diabetes only in female participants with the HDL-C-lowering allele increasing diabetes risk (p values: 3.2 Ã— 10(-4) to 7.7 Ã— 10(-5)); the association remained significant even after adjustment for HDL-C. Additional analysis across CETP identified rs6499863 as having the strongest association with type 2 diabetes in female participants (p = 5.0 Ã— 10(-6)) and this association remained independent of the HDL-C association._x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_

Conclusions/interpretation: SNPs at the CETP, HNF4A and KLF14 locus are associated with HDL-C levels and type 2 diabetes (in female participants). However, since HNF4A and KLF14 are established loci for type 2 diabetes, it is unlikely that HDL-C solely mediates these associations.","Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Child, Cholesterol Ester Transfer Proteins, Cholesterol, HDL, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2, Female, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 4, Humans, Indians, North American, Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors, Male, Middle Aged, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide, Sex Factors, Sp Transcription Factors, Young Adult",yes,yes,unk,yes,SA,26670163.0, Assessment of established HDL-C loci for association with HDL-C levels and type 2 diabetes in Pima Indians ,yes,yes,yes,Unknown,,False
11267683,Analysis of PBX1 as a candidate gene for type 2 diabetes mellitus in Pima Indians,"The human proto-oncogene PBX1 codes for a homeodomain containing protein that modulates expression of several genes, including those contributing to regulation of insulin action and glucose metabolism. PBX1 is located on chromosome 1q22, a region linked with type 2 diabetes in Pima Indians, Caucasians, and an Old Order Amish population. We have investigated the PBX1 genomic sequence to identify polymorphisms that may contribute to diabetes susceptibility in the Pimas. PBX1 is composed of nine exons spanning approx. 117 kb and is located within 300 kb of microsatellite D1S1677, which marks the peak of linkage to diabetes susceptibility in the Pima Indians. We detected 16 single nucleotide polymorphisms in PBX1 including one causing a glycine to serine substitution at residue 21. Comparison of the frequencies of the polymorphisms between affected and unaffected Pima Indians did not detect any significant differences, indicating that mutations in PBX1 do not explain the linkage of 1q with type 2 diabetes in this population. The genomic structure of PBX1 provides a basis for similar systematic examinations of this candidate locus in other populations in relation to both type 2 diabetes and other metabolic disorders.","3' Untranslated Regions, Base Sequence, DNA, Complementary, DNA-Binding Proteins, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2, Exons, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, Genetic Variation, Humans, Indians, North American, Introns, Molecular Sequence Data, Polymorphism, Genetic, Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1, Proto-Oncogene Mas, Proto-Oncogene Proteins, Tissue Distribution, United States",yes,yes,unk,yes,SA,11267683.0, Analysis of PBX1 as a candidate gene for type 2 diabetes mellitus in Pima Indians ,yes,yes,yes,Unknown,,False
1397719,Human GLUT4/muscle-fat glucose-transporter gene. Characterization and genetic variation,"Four overlapping DNA fragments spanning 32 kb containing the human GLUT4 facilitative glucose-transporter gene were isolated and characterized. The sequence of the GLUT4 gene (approximately 6.3 kb) and 2.0 kb of the promoter region was determined. The sequence of the promoter revealed potential binding sites for transcription factors known to regulate gene expression in muscle cells and adipocytes. However, transfection of constructs including 2 kb of the GLUT4 promoter fused to the bacterial CAT gene into 3T3-L1 adipocytes displayed only weak promoter activity. Because insulin resistance plays a prominent role in the development of NIDDM, genetic variation in the sequence of GLUT4 also was evaluated. Oligonucleotide primer pairs were selected that allowed the protein-coding region of the human GLUT4 gene to be amplified by PCR. The sequence of the protein-coding region of the GLUT4 gene and all intron-exon junctions was determined for a single diabetic Pima Indian and was identical to that of the cloned gene and cDNA. SSCP analysis was used to screen patients with diabetes mellitus and normal, healthy nondiabetic individuals for mutations at the GLUT4 locus. In addition to the silent substitution in the codon for Asn130 (AAC or AAT) and a Val383 (GTC)-->Ile(ATC) replacement described previously, two new variants were identified. One was a T-->A substitution in intron 1 that was found in 1 of 36 NIDDM patients who were typed for this variant. The second was a Ile385(ATT)-->Thr(ACT) replacement that occurred in 1 normal individual and was not found in any of 676 other normal and diabetic subjects. A large and racially diverse group of normal and diabetic individuals also was screened for the Ile383 polymorphism. It occurred in both diabetic and nondiabetic subjects. There is no indication from our data that these polymorphisms are associated with NIDDM.","3T3 Cells, Adipose Tissue, Adult, Amino Acid Sequence, Animals, Base Sequence, DNA, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2, Exons, Gene Library, Genetic Variation, Humans, Indians, North American, Liver, Mice, Molecular Sequence Data, Monosaccharide Transport Proteins, Muscles, Oligodeoxyribonucleotides, Oligonucleotides, Antisense, Polymerase Chain Reaction, Promoter Regions, Genetic, RNA Probes, Restriction Mapping, Transcription, Genetic, Transfection",yes,yes,unk,yes,SA,1397719.0, Human GLUT4/muscle-fat glucose-transporter gene.

To protect their people and culture and to retain oversight over research, many Native communities have established tribal health research and institutional review boards. The Treatment Options for Type 2 Diabetes in Adolescents and Youth (TODAY) Study showcases a successful, trusting research collaboration with tribal nations and academic investigators in Oklahoma. In 2006, the TODAY Study investigators proposed a modification of the study protocol to collect biological specimens from participants for genomic analyses and indefinite storage. Partnering American Indian tribal nations elected not to participate in the genomics collection and repository proposal. Reasons included 1) protection of cultural values, 2) concerns regarding community anonymity, 3) a potential threat to tribal services eligibility, 4) broad informed consent language, and 5) vague definitions of data access and usage. The nations believed the proposed genomics analyses presented a risk of harm to their people and nations without clear benefit. Since the 2006 proposal and the advancement of genomics research, many tribal communities in Oklahoma, appreciating the potential benefits of genomic research, are developing policies regarding oversight of/access to data and biological specimens to mitigate risks and provide members and communities with opportunities to participate in safe and meaningful genomic research.","Cooperative Behavior, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2, Genomics, Humans, Indians, North American, Oklahoma, Scientific Misconduct, Trust",yes,yes,unk,no,SA,31081852.0, Genomic Research and American Indian Tribal Communities in Oklahoma: Learning From Past Research Misconduct and Building Future Trusting Partnerships ,yes,yes,no,Unknown,,False
12882939,"Genetic modifiers of the age at diagnosis of diabetes (MODY3) in carriers of hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha mutations map to chromosomes 5p15, 9q22, and 14q24","Mutations in hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-1alpha (MODY3) account for the largest proportion of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) cases in the U.S. This form of diabetes is characterized by impaired insulin secretion in response to glucose, but wide variability exists in the severity of hyperglycemia and in the age at which it becomes clinically manifest. We have previously shown that the age at onset of diabetes in MODY3 families is influenced by familial factors (including modifying genes) and exposure to diabetes in utero. To identify genes influencing the onset of MODY3, we conducted a genome scan in 13 extended MODY families in which diabetes segregates with an HNF-1alpha mutation. Linkage with age at onset of diabetes was assessed by genetic variance component analysis using SOLAR. The locus with the strongest evidence of linkage was on chromosome 14q24 (D14S588; logarithm of odds [LOD] = 2.58, P = 0.0004). This location overlaps with IDDM11 and includes SEL1L, a negative regulator of the Notch pathway that may control islet development. Linkage evidence also supported loci on 5p15 (D5S817; LOD = 2.44, P = 0.0004) and 9q22 (D9S910; LOD = 2.02, P = 0.0018). The latter matches a region linked to 2-h insulin levels in Pima Indians. Less strong linkage evidence was observed at three other regions: chromosomes 3p24 (LOD = 1.44), 7q21 (1.20), and 16q23 (1.51). Our data are consistent with the existence of multiple loci that contribute to the expression of the MODY3 phenotype. Identification of these genes will offer new insights into the pathophysiology of MODY that may, in turn, increase our understanding of the cellular events underlying more common forms of diabetes.","Age of Onset, Chromosome Mapping, Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14, Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5, Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9, DNA-Binding Proteins, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2, Genetic Markers, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, Genotype, Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 1, Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 1-alpha, Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 1-beta, Humans, Lod Score, Mutation, Nuclear Proteins, Transcription Factors",yes,yes,unk,yes,SA,12882939.0," Genetic modifiers of the age at diagnosis of diabetes (MODY3) in carriers of hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha mutations map to chromosomes 5p15, 9q22, and 14q24 ",yes,yes,yes,Unknown,,False
7698519,Evidence for linkage between a region on chromosome 1p and the acute insulin response in Pima Indians,"A low acute insulin response (AIR) is a predictor of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) in insulin-resistant Pima Indians. We have initiated a search for regions of the genome linked with the AIR using sib-pair linkage analysis as a first step in identifying genes that are determinants of this phenotype. Eighteen short tandem-repeat polymorphisms from chromosome 1 were genotyped in over 900 Pima Indians and tested for linkage with NIDDM and in a subset of Pima Indians for linkage with AIR. The anonymous DNA marker D1S198 on chromosome 1p was linked with AIR (P = 0.000056) in 175 sib pairs from 60 families, all with normal glucose tolerance, but no linkage was observed between D1S198 and NIDDM (P = 0.44, 996 sib pairs). Additional markers genotyped on chromosome 1 did not show linkage with AIR or NIDDM. This study indicates that a locus on chromosome 1p may be a determinant of the phenotypic variation seen in the AIR.","Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2, Genetic Linkage, Genetic Markers, Glucose Transporter Type 2, Humans, Indians, North American, Insulin, Insulin Secretion, Monosaccharide Transport Proteins, Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid",yes,yes,unk,yes,SA,7698519.0, Evidence for linkage between a region on chromosome 1p and the acute insulin response in Pima Indians ,yes,yes,yes,Unknown,,False

18413187,Distribution of glyoxalase I polymorphism among Zuni Indians: the Zuni Kidney Project,"Zuni Indians are experiencing simultaneous epidemics of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and renal disease [Scavini, M., Stidley, C. A., Shah, V. O., Narva, A. S., Tentori, F., Kessler, D. S., et al. (2003). Prevalence of diabetes is higher among female than male Zuni Indians: Diabetes among Zuni Indians.

Epidemic of diabetic and nondiabetic renal disease among the Zuni Indians: The Zuni Kidney Project. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology, 14, 1320-1329]. Methylglyoxal (MG), a highly reactive, cytotoxic, cross-linking endogenous aldehyde involved in the modification of biologic macromolecules, is elevated among patients with T2DM. Glyoxalase I (Glo1) is the initial enzyme involved in the detoxification of MG. Glo1 is a dimeric enzyme with three isoforms Glo1-1, Glo2-1, and Glo2-2, resulting from a point mutation (A-->C) at position 332 of cDNA. The present study was conducted to explore the hypothesis that specific polymorphisms of the Glo1 gene are associated with diabetes and/or albuminuria in Zuni Indians. We studied four groups of Zuni Indians stratified by diabetes status and albuminuria, as assessed by the urinary albumin:creatinine ratio (UACR): Group I--normal controls; Group II--T2DM and UACR<0.03; Group III--T2DM and UACR>or=0.03; and Group IV--nondiabetic participants with UACR>or=0.03. Genomic DNA was used as template for polymerase chain reaction amplification of the Glo1 gene. Products were digested to yield 110-bp bands (homozygous, CC); 54- and 45-bp bands (homozygous, AA); or all three bands (heterozygous CA). Data on age, gender, UACR, serum creatinine, hemoglobin A1(c), serum glucose, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, and the duration of T2DM among participants in Groups II and III were analyzed using analysis of variance. A generalized linear model logistic regression analysis was used to assess the relationships between specific Glo1 polymorphisms to T2DM and UACR. All three Glo1 genotypes were present among Zuni Indians. There were no significant differences in the distributions of Glo1 genotypes among the study groups (chi-square test, P=.5590). The prevalence of Glo1 A allele was higher among diabetic participants (Groups II and III combined) than among nondiabetic participants (Groups I and IV combined) (chi-square test, P=.0233).

Linkage analyses were conducted for total cholesterol measured in 998 siblings from 292 nuclear families, for total triglycerides in 547 siblings from 188 families, and for high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol in 590 siblings from 201 families. Genotypes were generated for 516 autosomal microsatellite markers. Multipoint variance components methods were used to assess linkage. The strongest evidence for linkage with total cholesterol was on chromosome 19p (lod score 3.89), in the vicinity of the marker D19S1034, which is near the low density lipoprotein receptor gene. The strongest evidence for linkage with HDL cholesterol was on chromosome 3q (lod score 2.64) near D3S3053. For triglycerides, the strongest evidence for linkage was on chromosome 2p near D2S1788 (lod score 1.70) and on chromosome 3p near D3S2406 (lod score 1.77).

7598712,Genetic variability in the TNF-alpha promoter is not associated with type II diabetes mellitus (NIDDM),"Recent evidence suggests that expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) by adipocytes is a molecular mediator of insulin resistance in obesity. We have therefore tested the hypothesis that variations within the regulatory region of the TNF-alpha gene, which might cause increased adipocyte or generalized TNF-alpha synthesis, are associated with NIDDM, a state in which insulin resistance is routinely observed. Neither the previously known variants within the TNF-alpha promoter at position -308 and -238, nor two newly identified polymorphisms at position -376 and -163, were found at a significantly higher frequency in Caucasian NIDDM patients compared to non-diabetic controls. No genetic variants were found in Pima Indians. These data make it unlikely that mutations within regulatory elements of the TNF-alpha gene are associated with an increase in the prevalence of NIDDM.","Adult, Asian People, Base Sequence, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, Genetic Variation, Humans, Indians, North American, Middle Aged, Molecular Sequence Data, Prevalence, Promoter Regions, Genetic, Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha, White People",yes,yes,unk,yes,SA,7598712.0, Genetic variability in the TNF-alpha promoter is not associated with type II diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) ,yes,yes,yes,Unknown,,False
12920574,Association of a promoter variant in the inducible cyclooxygenase-2 gene (PTGS2) with type 2 diabetes mellitus in Pima Indians,"Recent studies have suggested that prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase-2 (PTGS2), also known as cyclo-oxygenase 2, plays an etiological role in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). PTGS2 generates prostaglandins, which negatively modulate glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, and functions as a mediator of the inflammatory response, which is associated with decreased insulin sensitivity. Moreover, the gene encoding this enzyme, PTGS2, is located on 1q25.2, a region that has been linked with early onset T2DM in Pima Indians. To determine the possible role played by PTGS2 in modulating susceptibility to T2DM, we screened approximately 7.0 kb of the gene, corresponding to the promoter, coding sequence, and flanking exon-intron boundaries, and identified five variants, including three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter, one intronic SNP, and one in the 3' untranslated region. With the exception of one rare promoter SNP (minor allele frequency <0.03), all SNPs were typed in approximately 1000 Pima Indians. The range of frequencies for the more common alleles was 0.65-0.88, and we found substantial linkage disequilibrium between all PTGS2 SNP pairs (D'>/=0.95). Variant alleles at two markers, rs20417 and rs2066826, which are located in the promoter and intron 6, respectively, were in strong linkage disequilibrium with each other (D'=0.97) and were associated with a higher prevalence of T2DM. For marker rs20417, individuals with the variant CC genotype had a 30% higher T2DM prevalence compared with subjects with the GG genotype (odds ratio=1.6 per copy of C allele; P=0.01). The variant C allele of rs20417 has been associated with decreased PTGS2 promoter activity, thereby suggesting a possible biological consequence attributable to this polymorphism. These findings indicate that genetic variants in PTGS2 may play a role in mediating susceptibility to T2DM in Pima Indians and are consistent with the hypothesis that chronic inflammation may contribute to the development of T2DM in some individuals.","Arizona, Base Sequence, Cyclooxygenase 2, DNA Primers, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2, Enzyme Induction, Exons, Female, Gene Frequency, Genes, Dominant, Genes, Recessive, Genetic Markers, Genetic Variation, Humans, Indians, North American, Introns, Isoenzymes, Male, Membrane Proteins, Nuclear Family, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide, Promoter Regions, Genetic, Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases",yes,yes,unk,yes,SA,12920574.0, Association of a promoter variant in the inducible cyclooxygenase-2 gene (PTGS2) with type 2 diabetes mellitus in Pima Indians ,yes,yes,yes,Unknown,,False
8940283,Using discordant sib pairs to map loci for qualitative traits with high sibling recurrence risk,"A common approach for detecting genetic linkage using siblings is to collect affected sib pairs (ASPs) and to identify markers where allele sharing exceeds expectation. Alternatively, markers can be analyzed in discordant sib pairs (DSPs) for allele sharing below expectation. Relative to the ASP approach, according to Risch, the power of the DSP approach increases with sibling recurrence risk, the two approaches being equally effective at 50% recurrence risk. However, with many diseases associated with more moderate sibling recurrence risk, less emphasis has been placed on the use of DSPs and the development of the underlying theory. In this paper, we expand the work of Risch to provide a more general foundation for DSP studies, since power can be quite high under the appropriate conditions. For example, in some highly affected populations, such as the diabetes-prone Pima Indians, sibling recurrence risk can be very large and, thus, DSPs ideal. Similarly, as we show through simulation, DSPs are preferable for diabetic nephropathy due to a 70% recurrence rate among siblings with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Following the diabetic nephropathy example, we consider more systematically the situations in which DSPs can provide an efficient alternative to ASPs.","Alleles, Chromosome Mapping, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1, Diabetic Nephropathies, Disease Susceptibility, Gene Frequency, Genetic Linkage, Humans, Models, Genetic, Nuclear Family, Phenotype",yes,yes,unk,yes,SA,8940283.0, Using discordant sib pairs to map loci for qualitative traits with high sibling recurrence risk ,yes,yes,yes,Unknown,,False
16174281,Assessing genetic susceptibility to diabetic nephropathy,"Diabetic nephropathy is a serious complication of diabetes and the leading cause of end-stage renal disease. Studies indicate both environmental and genetic factors contribute to the development and progression of diabetic nephropathy. In particular, epidemiological evidence shows a familial clustering of nephropathy in siblings with diabetes, supporting an important role of genetic susceptibility in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy. A common approach in genetic research is assessment of candidate gene polymorphisms using case-control analysis; a number of studies have evaluated predictable candidate genes for diabetic nephropathy. In contrast, only a few studies have used a whole genome approach, such as scanning of micro-satellite markers, in the assessment of genetic susceptibility to diabetic nephropathy. A whole genome linkage analysis using families of Pima Indians showed susceptibility loci for diabetic nephropathy on chromosome 3, 7, and 20. Another linkage analysis using discordant sib-pairs of Caucasian families with type 1 diabetes identified a critical area on chromosome 3q. However, these results have been inconclusive and further investigation is required. Recently, a genome-wide, case-control analysis identifying susceptibility genes for diabetic nephropathy was performed. As a result, a single nucleotide polymorphism in exon 23 of the solute carrier family 12 (sodium-chloride cotransporter) member 3 gene was found to be strongly associated with diabetic nephropathy. Although further assessment of this polymorphism is needed, this strategy offers great promise in the identification of genetic factors predisposing patients to diabetic nephropathy. Identification of genetic susceptibility markers may offer new hope in the diagnosis and treatment of diabetic nephropathy.","Diabetic Nephropathies, Genetic Linkage, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, Genome, Human, Genotype, Humans, Incidence, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",yes,yes,unk,yes,SA,16174281.0, Assessing genetic susceptibility to diabetic nephropathy ,yes,yes,no,"na, we",,False
35853479,Lipidomic profiling in the Strong Heart Study identified American Indians at risk of chronic kidney disease,"Dyslipidemia associates with and usually precedes the onset of chronic kidney disease (CKD), but a comprehensive assessment of molecular lipid species associated with risk of CKD is lacking. Here, we sought to identify fasting plasma lipids associated with risk of CKD among American Indians in the Strong Heart Family Study, a large-scale community-dwelling of individuals, followed by replication in Mexican Americans from the San Antonio Family Heart Study and Caucasians from the Australian Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle Study. We also performed repeated measurement analysis to examine the temporal relationship between the change in the lipidome and change in kidney function between baseline and follow-up of about five years apart. Network analysis was conducted to identify differential lipid classes associated with risk of CKD. In the discovery cohort, we found that higher baseline level of multiple lipid species, including glycerophospholipids, glycerolipids and sphingolipids, was significantly associated with increased risk of CKD, independent of age, sex, body mass index, diabetes and hypertension. Many lipid species were replicated in at least one external cohort at the individual lipid species and/or the class level. Longitudinal change in the plasma lipidome was significantly associated with change in the estimated glomerular filtration rate after adjusting for covariates, baseline lipids and the baseline rate. Network analysis identified distinct lipidomic signatures differentiating high from low-risk groups. Thus, our results demonstrated that disturbed lipid metabolism precedes the onset of CKD. These findings shed light on the mechanisms linking dyslipidemia to CKD and provide potential novel biomarkers for identifying individuals with early impaired kidney function at preclinical stages.","American Indian or Alaska Native, Australia, Biomarkers, Diabetes Mellitus, Dyslipidemias, Glomerular Filtration Rate, Glycerophospholipids, Humans, Lipidomics, Renal Insufficiency, Chronic, Sphingolipids",no,no,unk,yes,SA,35853479.0, Lipidomic profiling in the Strong Heart Study identified American Indians at risk of chronic kidney disease ,yes,no,yes,Unknown,,False

The underlying mechanism(s) of this association is not fully understood. Pima Indians have a low incidence of nonfatal and fatal CAD despite a high prevalence of diabetes. In Pima Indians, circulating ACE levels are related to ACE genotype, but the frequency of the D allele is significantly lower than in Caucasians. A lower frequency of the D allele may underlie a low risk of CAD in this population. We examined the relationship of the ACE genotype and plasma ACE level with electrocardiographic evidence of CAD (Tecumseh criteria), hypertension, and metabolic variables associated with insulin resistance in 305 (146 men and 159 women aged 47+/-9.0 years) Pima Indians characterized for the ACE I/D genotype. The distribution of ACE genotypes was unrelated to diabetes and obesity. Fasting plasma insulin, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) activity, plasma triglyceride concentrations, and systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure were not significantly different between the three ACE genotypes among nondiabetic and diabetic subjects. There was no significant association of ACE genotype with electrocardiographic evidence of CAD or with hypertension. Plasma ACE concentrations were not significantly different between nondiabetic and diabetic subjects (median, 77 [range, 21 to 1691 v 83 [7 to 238] IU/mL, P=NS). In all subjects, plasma ACE levels were associated weakly with plasma triglyceride (partial r=.20, P < .01) and total cholesterol (partial r=.13, P <.03) concentrations, but not with fasting plasma insulin or PAI-1 activity. In diabetic subjects, ACE levels were related to fasting plasma glucose concentrations (partial r=.15, P=.07). These findings would suggest that ACE gene I/D polymorphism is unlikely to be a major determinant of susceptibility to CAD in Pima Indians.

32640185,"Characterization of Exome Variants and Their Metabolic Impact in 6,716 American Indians from the Southwest US","Applying exome sequencing to populations with unique genetic architecture has the potential to reveal novel genes and variants associated with traits and diseases. We sequenced and analyzed the exomes of 6,716 individuals from a Southwestern American Indian (SWAI) population with well-characterized metabolic traits. We found that the SWAI population has distinct allelic architecture compared to populations of European and East Asian ancestry, and there were many predicted loss-of-function (pLOF) and nonsynonymous variants that were highly enriched or private in the SWAI population. We used pLOF and nonsynonymous variants in the SWAI population to evaluate gene-burden associations of candidate genes from European genome-wide association studies (GWASs) for type 2 diabetes, body mass index, and four major plasma lipids. We found 19 significant gene-burden associations for 11 genes, providing additional evidence for prioritizing candidate effector genes of GWAS signals. Interestingly, these associations were mainly driven by pLOF and nonsynonymous variants that are unique or highly enriched in the SWAI population. Particularly, we found four pLOF or nonsynonymous variants in APOB, APOE, PCSK9, and TM6SF2 that are private or enriched in the SWAI population and associated with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. Their large estimated effects on LDL cholesterol levels suggest strong impacts on protein function and potential clinical implications of these variants in cardiovascular health. In summary, our study illustrates the utility and potential of exome sequencing in genetically unique populations, such as the SWAI population, to prioritize candidate effector genes within GWAS loci and to find additional variants in known disease genes with potential clinical impact.","Alleles, Body Mass Index, Exome, Female, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, Genetics, Population, Genome-Wide Association Study, Humans, Indians, North American, Male, Phenotype, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide, Southwestern United States",yes,yes,unk,yes,SA,32640185.0," Characterization of Exome Variants and Their Metabolic Impact in 6,716 American Indians from the Southwest US ",yes,yes,yes,Unknown,,False

Mutations in the UCP2 and/or UCP3 gene have been associated with sleeping metabolic rate. Recently we reported that skeletal muscle UCP3 mRNA expression was positively correlated with sleeping metabolic rate in Pima Indians. To study whether genetic variation in the promoter region of UCP3 contributed to the variation in expression of UCP3, we screened part of the proximal promoter region for polymorphisms._x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_

10222257,Protein targeting to glycogen/PPP1R5: screening of coding and flanking genomic regions for polymorphisms and association analysis with insulin action in Pima Indians,"Insulin resistance, a major predictor of type 2 diabetes mellitus, is genetically inherited in Pima Indians, a population with a high prevalence of the metabolically complex disease. Protein targeting to glycogen/PPP1R5 has recently been identified as a potential regulator of glycogen synthase, the rate-limiting enzyme of the insulin-induced glycogenesis. The gene is located on chromosome 10q23-24, where there is a suggestive linkage to insulin action in this population, establishing it as a functional and positional candidate gene. In this study, we discovered 2 novel polymorphisms upstream of the 5'UTR of the gene, with only one found in Pima Indians, but no polymorphism in the coding sequence. The genotype frequencies of the polymorphism and transcript levels of the gene in skeletal muscle do not correlate with insulin action in the subjects.

19409197,"[Biomarkers: ""Found in translation""]","Despite continued increase in global Pharma R & D expenditure, the number of innovative drugs obtaining market approval has declined since 1994. The pharmaceutical industry is now entering a crucial juncture where increasing rates of attrition in clinical drug development as well as increasing development timelines are impacted by external factors such as intense regulatory pricing and safety pressures, increasing sales erosion due to generics, as well as exponential increases in the costs of bringing a drug to market. Despite these difficulties, numerous opportunities exist such as multiple unmet medical needs, the increasing incidence of certain diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, cancer, diabetes and obesity due to demographic changes, as well as the emergence of evolving markets such as China, India, and Eastern Europe. Consequently, Pharma is now responding to this challenge by improving both the productivity and the innovation in its drug discovery and development pipelines. In this regard, the advent of new technologies and expertise such as genomics, proteomics, structural biology, and molecular informatics in an integrated systems biology approach also provides a powerful opportunity for Pharma to address some of these difficulties. The key features behind this new strategy imply a discovery process based on an improved understanding of the molecular mechanism of diseases and drugs, translational research that places the patient at the center of the research process, and the application of biomarkers throughout the discovery and development phases. Moreover, new paradigms are required to improve target validation and develop more predictive cellular and animal models of human pathologies, a greater capacity in informatics-based analysis, and, consequently, a greater access to the vast sources of accumulating biological data and its integrated analysis. In the present review, we will address some of these issues and in particular emphasize how the application of biomarkers could potentially lead to improved productivity, quality, and innovation in drug discovery and ultimately better and safer medicines with improved therapeutic efficacy in specific pathologies for targeted patients.","Biomarkers, Disease Progression, Drug Approval, Drug Delivery Systems, Drug Design, Drug Discovery, Drug Monitoring, Drugs, Investigational, Humans, Prognosis",no,no,sa,no,SA,19409197.0, Biomarkers: 'Found in translation' ,yes,no,no,not specified,,False

It is commonly recognized that this familial aggregation of human obesity is accounted for in part by a significant genetic component. Thus the genetic heritability of the obesity phenotypes accounts for approximately 25-40% of the age- and gender-adjusted phenotypic variances. There is also growing evidence that single-gene effects can be detected under appropriate conditions. The focus of research has now shifted to candidate genes and DNA markers of various obesity phenotypes. To date, linkage results have been published from the Pima Indian Study, the San Antonio Family Heart or Diabetes Studies, the Paris Cohort of Obese Siblings, the University of Pennsylvania Family Obesity Study and the Quebec Family Study. The only genomic scan (with approximately 600 markers) reported to date is that from the Pima Indian sibling study. In that study, the strongest evidence for linkage with body fat was with markers on chromosome 11q, 6p and 3p. Evidence for linkage with markers on 7q was obtained in all family studies with the only apparent exception being the Pima Indians. Our own results from the Quebec Family Study suggest that there are linkages between body fat, as assessed from hydrodensitometry, and markers on 1p32-p22.

Human Genome Epidemiology,"Hereditary hemochromatosis (HHC) is an autosomal recessive disorder of iron metabolism characterized by increased iron absorption and deposition in the liver, pancreas, heart, joints, and pituitary gland. Without treatment, death may occur from cirrhosis, primary liver cancer, diabetes, or cardiomyopathy. In 1996, HFE, the gene for HHC, was mapped on the short arm of chromosome 6 (6p21.3). Two of the 37 allelic variants of HFE described to date (C282Y and H63D) are significantly correlated with HHC. Homozygosity for the C282Y mutation was found in 52-100% of previous studies on clinically diagnosed probands. In this review, 5% of HHC probands were found to be compound heterozygotes (C282Y/H63D), and 1.5% were homozygous for the H63D mutation; 3.6% were C282Y heterozygotes, and 5.2% were H63D heterozygotes. In 7% of cases, C282Y and H63D mutations were not present. In the general population, the frequency of the C282Y/C282Y genotype is 0.4%. C282Y heterozygosity ranges from 9.2% in Europeans to nil in Asian, Indian subcontinent, African/Middle Eastern, and Australasian populations. The H63D carrier frequency is 22% in European populations. Accurate data on the penetrance of the different HFE genotypes are not available. Extrapolating from limited clinical observations in screening studies, an estimated 40--70% of persons with the C282Y homozygous genotype will develop clinical evidence of iron overload. A smaller proportion will die from complications of iron overload. To date, population screening for HHC is not recommended because of uncertainties about optimal screening strategies, optimal care for susceptible persons, laboratory standardization, and the potential for stigmatization or discrimination.","Alleles, Asian People, Black People, Gene Frequency, Genetic Carrier Screening, Genetic Linkage, Genetic Testing, Global Health, HLA Antigens, Hemochromatosis, Hemochromatosis Protein, Histocompatibility Antigens Class I, Homozygote, Humans, Internet, Membrane Proteins, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, White People",yes,no,sa,no,SA,11479183.0, HFE gene and hereditary hemochromatosis: a HuGE review.

11753282,"Hickam 2000: the maturation of, and linkages between, medical informatics and bioinformatics","I have always been infatuated with computers and convinced of their potential for solving problems in biologic research and clinical care. In the 1960s I thought we could use the computer to predict the shape of macromolecules from their chemical formulas and fundamental physical chemical principles. However, with the computers of the 1960s that was a fantasy. So I focused on the use of computers to manage medical record content and to assist with clinical care. The Electronic Medical Record (EMR) we began developing in 1972 with 33 diabetes patients now carries nearly 300 million separate results for more than 3 million patients. The data include lab and other diagnostic studies, dictated notes, orders, encounter records, radiology images, electrocardiograph tracings, and motion cardiac echoes, and the care provider at Indiana University and Wishard Hospital is accessed 10 million times per year. We have also agitated for standards to make the collection of these data easier. This work has become part of a field called medical informatics. In the meantime, the application of computers to biology has rapidly matured into a field called bioinformatics, and researchers in this field now provide annotated databases for many categories of molecules, programs for ""matching"" newly discovered genomic sequences with previously studied sequences, and systems for storing and processing massive amounts of genomic and molemic data. They have developed sophisticated methods for predicting the shape of biologic macromolecules and other important insights about biology and evolution. Medical informatics and bioinformatics intersect at many points. The most important intersection is between electronic medical records and the human specimen databases that can link genotype to the phenotype, as needed, to unravel polygenetic disease causality. The National Cancer Institute is embarking on an intriguing effort to use EMRs (phenotype) to link to paraffin blocks (genotype) in pathology laboratories where opportunities for cancer genomic discovery are open.

Two alleles, Z + 10 and Z - 15, appear to be unique to American Blacks, while a Z + 6 allele was observed only in the Caucasian population studied. Observed heterozygosity of the polymorphism in the CEPH reference pedigree collection is 44% and the PIC 0.44. The polymorphism is assayed by PCR amplification and resolution of 32P-end-labeled products (ranging in length from 180 to 205 bp) on denaturing polyacrylamide sequencing gels. Using the PCR assay, the human glucokinase gene was physically localized to chromosome 7 in a panel of rodent/human somatic cell lines. Genetic analysis in CEPH pedigrees placed the dinucleotide repeat element, and thereby the human glucokinase gene, on chromosome 7p between TCRG and a RFLP locus D7S57. The glucokinase dinucleotide repeat genetic marker can now be used to assess the role of the glucokinase gene in diabetes by population association studies. In addition, this repeat marker and others flanking it on chromosome 7 can be used in linkage studies with families segregating the disorder.","Alleles, Base Sequence, Chromosome Mapping, Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7, DNA, Gene Frequency, Genetic Linkage, Genetic Markers, Glucokinase, Heterozygote, Humans, Molecular Sequence Data, Polymorphism, Genetic, Racial Groups, Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid",yes,yes,unk,yes,SA,1740341.0, A polymorphic (CA)n repeat element maps the human glucokinase gene (GCK) to chromosome 7p ,yes,yes,yes,Unknown,,False
34220960,Admixture Has Shaped Romani Genetic Diversity in Clinically Relevant Variants,"Genetic patterns of inter-population variation are a result of different demographic and adaptive histories, which gradually shape the frequency distribution of the variants. However, the study of clinically relevant mutations has a Eurocentric bias. The Romani, the largest transnational minority ethnic group in Europe, originated in South Asia and received extensive gene flow from West Eurasia. Most medical genetic studies have only explored founder mutations related to Mendelian disorders in this population. Here we analyze exome sequences and genome-wide array data of 89 healthy Spanish Roma individuals to study complex traits and disease. We apply a different framework and focus on variants with both increased and decreased allele frequencies, taking into account their local ancestry. We report several OMIM traits enriched for genes with deleterious variants showing increased frequencies in Roma or in non-Roma (e.g., obesity is enriched in Roma, with an associated variant linked to South Asian ancestry; while non-insulin dependent diabetes is enriched in non-Roma Europeans). In addition, previously reported pathogenic variants also show differences among populations, where some variants segregating at low frequency in non-Roma are virtually absent in the Roma. Lastly, we describe frequency changes in drug-response variation, where many of the variants increased in Roma are clinically associated with metabolic and cardiovascular-related drugs. These results suggest that clinically relevant variation in Roma cannot only be characterized in terms of founder mutations. Instead, we observe frequency differences compared to non-Roma: some variants are absent, while other have drifted to higher frequencies. As a result of the admixture events, these clinically damaging variants can be traced back to both European and South Asian-related ancestries. This can be attributed to a different prevalence of some genetic disorders or to the fact that genetic susceptibility variants are mostly studied in populations of European descent, and can differ in individuals with different ancestries.",,yes,yes,sa,yes,SA,34220960.0, Admixture Has Shaped Romani Genetic Diversity in Clinically Relevant Variants ,yes,yes,yes,we,,False
15805049,Idiosyncratic liver injury: challenges and approaches,"Clinical presentations of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) cover essentially the entire spectrum of known liver diseases. However, in the last 8 years the form of liver injury that has most frequently resulted in labeling restrictions is idiosyncratic hepatocellular injury leading to acute liver failure. This rare form of DILI has a characteristic clinical presentation that includes an acute onset after uneventful treatment with drug for weeks to months. Serum alanine aminotransferase rises to very high levels and the appearance of jaundice indicates a high mortality even if the therapy is discontinued. Drugs that can cause this type of injury almost always are associated with frequent (2-15% of all treated patients) and minor serum aminotransferase elevations. These elevations are believed to reflect true liver injury, but often reverse even if drug therapy is continued. The bases for this ""adaptation"" is not known, as is why some patients do not adapt and develop progressive liver injury. Understanding how drugs cause severe idiosyncratic hepatocellular toxicity has been frustrated by the lack of good preclinical models. Indeed, because these events occur so rarely, the vast majority of humans are not good models. Studies of genomic DNA from affected individuals should provide important insight but not the complete answer because environmental factors almost certainly contribute to individual susceptibility. The most fruitful approach may therefore lie in focused and well-controlled phenotype/genotype studies of the rare patients who have survived this type of injury. The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases of The National Institutes of Health has recently sponsored a cooperative agreement (UO1) to create a Drug Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN). DILIN consists of University of Michigan, Indiana University, University of Connecticut, University of California, San Francisco, University of North Carolina, and Duke University. This network should provide heretofore missing resources required to address the problem.","Adaptation, Physiological, Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury, Chronic, Chromans, Humans, Hypoglycemic Agents, Jaundice, Liver Diseases, Liver Failure, Acute, Liver Function Tests, Necrosis, Thiazolidinediones, Transaminases, Troglitazone",no,no,unk,no,SA,15805049.0, Idiosyncratic liver injury: challenges and approaches ,yes,no,no,Unknown,,False
31105750,Population Levels Assessment of the Distribution of Disease-Associated Variants With Emphasis on Armenians - A Machine Learning Approach,"Background: During the last decades a number of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) has identified numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with different complex diseases. However, associations reported in one population are often conflicting and did not replicate when studied in other populations. One of the reasons could be that most GWAS employ a case-control design in one or a limited number of populations, but little attention was paid to the global distribution of disease-associated alleles across different populations. Moreover, the majority of GWAS have been performed on selected European, African, and Chinese populations and the considerable number of populations remains understudied. Aim: We have investigated the global distribution of so far discovered disease-associated SNPs across worldwide populations of different ancestry and geographical regions with a special focus on the understudied population of Armenians. Data and Methods: We have used genotyping data from the Human Genome Diversity Project and of Armenian population and combined them with disease-associated SNP data taken from public repositories leading to a final dataset of 44,234 markers. Their frequency distribution across 1039 individuals from 53 populations was analyzed using self-organizing maps (SOM) machine learning. Our SOM portrayal approach reduces data dimensionality, clusters SNPs with similar frequency profiles and provides two-dimensional data images which enable visual evaluation of disease-associated SNPs landscapes among human populations.

25092227,Corosolic acid content and SSR markers in Lagerstroemia speciosa (L.) Pers.: a comparative analysis among populations across the Southern Western Ghats of India,"Lagerstroemia speciosa commonly known as 'Banaba' is native of south-east Asia which exhibits both horticultural and therapeutic value. The anti-diabetic and anti-obese property of the tree is attributed to corosolic acid (CRA)-a pentacyclic triterpene seen predominantly in the mature leaves. Although there are studies on either chemical or genetic variation in L. speciosa from different regions, none have dealt with their association to discuss the formation of chemical diversity. For the first time, we have analyzed CRA content in 12 natural populations corresponding to 42 samples seen in the Southern Western Ghats (SWG) using chromatography techniques and genetic variation estimated using SSR markers. Significant variation in percentage distribution of CRA ranging from 0.005% to 0.868% dr.wt. was recorded wherein populations from the north SWG contain relatively more active principle (mean=0.321%) than their counterparts in the south (mean=0.064%). Similarly, SSR data showing relatively high rate of gene flow (Nm=2.72) and low genetic differentiation (FST=0.14) is indicative that populations from north are genetically more diverse than those in the south (Nm=0.48; FST=0.38). The scatter plot derived by Principle Component Analysis (PCA) of chemical and genetic data shows similar pattern of clustering that reveals strong association between the two sets of data. It is concluded that the observed variation in CRA content in natural populations of the species depends more on the genetic background and less on edaphic factors.Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The purpose of this investigation was to determine the effect of the ND1 gene polymorphism on mitochondrial function in 14 male Pima Indians.Seven subjects with an A at site 3547 of the ND1 gene (Ile at amino acid 81), and seven with a G at this site (Val) were studied. Mitochondria were isolated from 0.8 to 1.5 g of skeletal muscle obtained by needle biopsy of the lateral quadriceps muscle. In intact mitochondria, maximal (state-3) and resting (state-4) respiration rates were measured polarographically at 37 degrees C with a variety of single substrates or substrate combinations. Disrupted mitochondria were analyzed for maximal capacities through the entire electron transport chain (ETC) (NADH oxidase (NADHOX)), as well as through a segment of Complex I that is independent of the ND1 component (NADH-ferricyanide (NADH-FeCN) reductase).Mitochondria were well coupled and exhibited higher respiratory control ratios (RCRs) than rodent muscle. There were no differences between the two groups for any of the measured parameters.These results indicate that the cause of the observed association between RMR and the ND1 polymorphism is not related to in vitro mitochondrial function.","Adult, Basal Metabolism, Biopsy, Cohort Studies, Electron Transport Chain Complex Proteins, Energy Metabolism, Genes, Mitochondrial, Humans, Indians, North American, Male, Mitochondria, Muscle, Muscle, Skeletal, NADH Dehydrogenase, Polymorphism, Genetic",yes,no,unk,yes,SA,18239645.0, Effect of a polymorphism in the ND1 mitochondrial gene on human skeletal muscle mitochondrial function ,yes,no,yes,Unknown,,False

We systematically selected (i.e. every 100th individual in the central Dubai COVID-19 database) 256 patients by age, sex, disease severity and month to provide a representative sample of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients (nasopharyngeal swab PCR positive) during the first wave of the UAE outbreak (January to June 2020). Sociodemographic and clinical data were extracted from medical records and full SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences extracted from nasopharyngeal swabs were analysed. Older age was significantly associated with COVID-19-associated hospital admission and mortality. Overweight/obese or diabetic patients were 3-4 times more likely to be admitted to hospital and intensive care unit (ICU). Sequencing data showed multiple independent viral introductions into the UAE from Europe, Iran and Asia (29 January-18 March), and these early strains seeded significant clustering consistent with almost exclusive community-based transmission between April and June 2020. Majority of sequenced strains (N = 60, 52%) were from the European cluster consistent with the higher infectivity rates associated with the D614G mutation carried by most strains in this cluster. A total of 986 mutations were identified in 115 genomes, 272 were unique (majority were missense, n = 134) and 20/272 mutations were novel. A missense (Q271R) and synonymous (R41R) mutation in the S and N proteins, respectively, were identified in 2/27 patients with severe COVID-19 but not in patients with mild or moderate disease (0/86; p = .05, Fisher's Exact Test). Both patients were women (51-64 years) with no significant underlying health conditions. The same two mutations were identified in a healthy 37-year-old Indian man who was hospitalized in India due to COVID-19.

26213322,"1, 25(OH)2D3 protects Î² cell against high glucose-induced apoptosis through mTOR suppressing","Diabetes mellitus is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide, which presents a serious public health crisis in China nowadays. It has been well recognized that excessive Î²-cell apoptosis is the key pathogenesis of diabetes, of which the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) serves as the critical signaling pathway. Emerging evidence indicates that vitamin D deficiency acts as a potential risk factor for diabetes. The present study aims to test the hypothesis that 1 alpha, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) [1, 25(OH)2D3] can inhibit Î²-cell apoptosis via the suppression of mTOR signaling pathway. Î²-cells (INS-1) were cultured in the context of normal glucose or high glucose media with or without 1, 25(OH)2D3 treatment. Î²-cell apoptosis was evaluated by inverted fluorescence microscope, flow cytometry and electron microscope, respectively. Quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting were performed to assess the possible perturbations in mTOR signaling pathway. High glucose significantly increased Î²-cell apoptosis. Of importance, RT-PCR and Western blotting demonstrated that high glucose inhibited DNA-damage-inducible transcript 4 (DDIT4) and TSC1/TSC2, up-regulated Rheb/mTOR/p70S6K and enhanced expression of the apoptosis regulating proteins, such as phospho-Bcl-2, cytochrome C and cleaved caspase. Interestingly, 1, 25(OH)2D3 treatment reversed high glucose induced pathological changes in mTOR signaling pathway, restored expression of DDIT4 and TSC1/TSC2, blocked aberrant up-regulation of Rheb/mTOR/p70S6K and the apoptosis regulating proteins, and effectively inhibited Î²-cell apoptosis. Therefore, 1, 25(OH)2D3 treatment can effectively protects Î² cell against high glucose-induced apoptosis mainly via the suppression of mTOR signaling pathway, which may be considered as a potential therapy for patients with diabetes._x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_

PIP: Medical researchers enrolled 100 women who use the NORPLANT 6 capsule system and 100 women who used the NORPLANT 2 rod system in a clinical trial at the National University Hospital in Singapore to compare the 2 implants' effects on clinical chemistry. The mean bilirubin levels increased 55% during the 1st year for both groups. These levels fell a mere 4.5% in the NORPLANT-2 group. Still, at the end of 2 years, the mean bilirubin levels of both groups were significantly higher than preinsertion levels. Total proteins and globulins fell significantly in both groups during the 2 year study. The mean albumin level rose significantly in the NORPLANT-2 women and the slight risk in NORPLANT-6 women was not significant. Even though these changes in liver function occurred, the mean levels of bilirubin, total protein, globulin, and albumin stayed within the normal clinical range. Further no individual had levels outside the normal range. NORPLANT-6 and NORPLANT-2 had basically similar effects on lipid metabolism. The high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol/total cholesterol ratio was .200 for both groups indicating that the 2 NORPLANT systems did not put women at increased risk of coronary heart disease. In addition, the low density lipoprotein cholesterol/HDL ratio for both groups did not rise higher that the preinsertion level. These results indicated that the 2 systems may actually have a protective effect against cardiovascular conditions in the 1st 2 years. Neither NORPLANT-6 nor NORPLANT-2 significantly changed carbohydrate metabolism. At the end of 1 hour, however, the glucose tolerance levels significantly increased, but fell considerably at 2 hours. In fact, absolute glucose tolerance levels stayed in the normal range. In conclusion, the 2 systems acted essentially the same.","Capsules, Carbohydrate Metabolism, Contraceptive Agents, Female, Contraceptives, Oral, Combined, Drug Implants, Female, Humans, Levonorgestrel, Lipid Metabolism, Liver",no,no,ea,yes,EA,2130749.0, A comparison of the effects of NORPLANT capsules and NORPLANT-2 rods on clinical chemistry: metabolic changes ,no,no,yes,seap,,False

Here, we analyzed and compared the chemical composition of fresh stems of D. officinale and TPFD and explored possible explanations for the enhanced medicinal efficacy of processed D. officinale stems using qualitative and quantitative methods. To identify the components of FSD and TPFD, we used ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography combined with mass spectrometry in negative and positive ion modes and interpreted the data using the Human Metabolome Database and multivariate statistical analysis. We detected 23,709 peaks and identified 2352 metabolites; 370 of these metabolites were differentially abundant between FSD and TPFD (245 more abundant in TPFD than in FSD, and 125 less abundant), including organooxygen compounds, prenol lipids, flavonoids, carboxylic acids and their derivatives, and fatty acyls. Of these, 43 chemical markers clearly distinguished between FSD and TPFD samples, as confirmed using orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis. A pharmacological activity analysis showed that, compared with FSD, TPFD had significantly higher levels of some metabolites with anti-inflammatory activity, consistent with its use to treat inflammation.

18164359,Toxicological effects of cinnabar in rats by NMR-based metabolic profiling of urine and serum,"Cinnabar, an important traditional Chinese mineral medicine, has been widely used as a Chinese patent medicine ingredient for sedative therapy. However, the pharmaceutical and toxicological effects of cinnabar, especially in the whole organism, were subjected to few investigations. In this study, an NMR-based metabolomics approach has been applied to investigate the toxicological effects of cinnabar after intragastrical administration (dosed at 0.5, 2 and 5 g/kg body weight) on male Wistar rats. Liver and kidney histopathology examinations and serum clinical chemistry analyses were also performed. The 1H NMR spectra were analyzed using multivariate pattern recognition techniques to show the time- and dose-dependent biochemical variations induced by cinnabar. The metabolic signature of urinalysis from cinnabar-treated animals exhibited an increase in the levels of creatinine, acetate, acetoacetate, taurine, hippurate and phenylacetylglycine, together with a decrease in the levels of trimethyl-N-oxide, dimethylglycine and Kreb's cycle intermediates (citrate, 2-oxoglutarate and succinate). The metabolomics analyses of serum showed elevated concentrations of ketone bodies (3-d-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate), branched-chain amino acids (valine, leucine and isoleucine), choline and creatine as well as decreased glucose, lipids and lipoproteins from cinnabar-treated animals. These findings indicated cinnabar induced disturbance in energy metabolism, amino acid metabolism and gut microflora environment as well as slight injury in liver and kidney, which might indirectly result from cinnabar induced oxidative stress. This work illustrated the high reliability of NMR-based metabolomic approach on the study of the biochemical effects induced by traditional Chinese medicine.","Animals, Kidney, Least-Squares Analysis, Liver, Male, Medicine, Chinese Traditional, Mercury Compounds, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular, Rats, Rats, Wistar, Serum, Urinalysis, Urine",yes,no,Unknown,yes,EA,18164359.0, Toxicological effects of cinnabar in rats by NMR-based metabolic profiling of urine and serum ,no,no,yes,none,,False
9296071,Gene technology and social acceptance,"About 10% of the human genome has now been mapped and for more than 1000 diseases closely linked DNA polymorphisms or the responsible genes have been identified. These developments have extended the scope of (prenatal) diagnosis and carrier detection which already was possible by biochemical analysis of protein defects in some 400 Mendelian disorders. Together with the study of chromosomal aberrations these activities form the basis for genetic counselling and carrier screening programmes. A brief overview of the activities in clinical genetics will be presented and their importance for the prevention of congenital disorders and for informed decisions of couples at risk will be emphasized. Reproductive decisions are, however very closely related to culture, religion, education and the socioeconomic status of individuals and populations. Up to now genetic services have mainly been developed in wealthy postindustrial countries with a low infant mortality. But even among these countries there are major differences in the implementation of gene technology as will be shown by comparisons of the United States, Europe and Japan. In the developing countries where about 95% of the world's future children will be born there are major hindrances in the development of clinical genetics such as poverty, illiteracy of women, low contraceptive use and a high infant mortality. There are, however, examples of developing countries that give high priority to the application of gene technology such as Cuba and China. While the developing countries are struggling to improve their basic health care, research on gene technology in the western countries proceeds fast. The early identification of a particular gene constitution will show whether a young adult is at higher risk of important diseases such as various forms of cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes or psychiatric disorders.

32063848,Network Pharmacology-Based Strategy to Investigate the Pharmacologic Mechanisms of Atractylodes macrocephala Koidz. for the Treatment of Chronic Gastritis,"Chronic gastritis (CG) is an inflammatory disease. Atractylodes macrocephala Koidz (AMK) is employed in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) to treat various disorders. AMK can be efficacious against CG, but the active ingredients, drug targets, and its exact molecular mechanism are not known. We employed network pharmacology to analyze the active ingredients, drug targets, and key pathways of AMK in CG treatment. Seventy-seven AMK candidate ingredients were selected from four databases, and 27 active ingredients were selected for CG treatment. Twenty-five overlapping gene symbols related to CG and drugs were obtained from GeneCards and OMIM databases. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and TCM comprehensive network (Drug-Ingredients-Gene symbols-Disease network) were constructed, and 528 Gene Ontology (GO) terms and 26 pathways were obtained by analyses of enrichment of GO pathways and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways. We suggest that the interleukin-17 signaling pathway, C-type lectin receptor signaling pathway, tumor necrosis factor signaling pathway, and AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications might serve as the key points and principal pathways for CG treatment. We also evaluated the reliability of some important active ingredients and targets by in vitro experiments. We showed that AMK probably influences the inflammatory response, amino acid synthesis, and energy metabolism when treating CG.

31400481,Development of species-specific chloroplast markers for the authentication of Gynostemma pentaphyllum and their distribution in the Korean peninsula,"Gynostemma pentaphyllum is a traditional oriental medicinal herb used as tea since ancient time. Among Gynostemma species, G. pentaphyllum has more active chemical components and better therapeutic effect. It is used to cure depression, diabetes, anxiety, hyperlipidemia, fatigue, immunity, cancer, and oxidative stress. Overexploitation of G. pentaphyllum for its medicinal benefits has been on a rise, due to which they are adulterated or mistakenly identified with other members of Gynostemma species. Hence, we used chloroplast universal regions such as ycf3, accD, petD, psbB and their polymorphism to distinguish G. pentaphyllum from other Gynostemma species. By using the species-specific primers derived from the above regions, we established a multiplex allele-specific PCR for the authentication of G. pentaphyllum from other species. Thus the PCR reaction produced unique amplicons of size 244â€¯bp and 438â€¯bp for G. pentaphyllum amplified by the primers flanking ycf3, and accD regions respectively. While a 607â€¯bp, and 787â€¯bp amplicons from the primers targeting psbB, and petD regions distinguished G. longipes, G. burmanicum, and G. pubescens species. Moreover, these primers were successful to analyze the dried tea samples of Gynostemma as well. Thus, the developed molecular markers could authenticate different Gynostemma species as well as its products thereby preventing the mistaken-identity of this medicinal herb.Copyright Â© 2019 Elsevier B.V.

25652794,Integrating transcriptomics and proteomics to show that tanshinone IIA suppresses cell growth by blocking glucose metabolism in gastric cancer cells,"Background: Tanshinone IIA (TIIA) is a diterpene quinone extracted from the plant Danshen (Salvia miltiorrhiza) used in traditional Chinese herbal medicine. It has been reported to have anti-tumor potential against several kinds of cancer, including gastric cancer. In most solid tumors, a metabolic switch to glucose is a hallmark of cancer cells, which do this to provide nutrients for cell proliferation. However, the mechanism associated with glucose metabolism by which TIIA acts on gastric cancer cells remains to be elucidated._x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_
Results: We found that TIIA treatment is able to significantly inhibit cell growth and the proliferation of gastric cancer in a dose-dependent manner. Using next-generation sequencing-based RNA-seq transcriptomics and quantitative proteomics-isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ), we characterized the mechanism of TIIA regulation in gastric cancer cell line AGS. In total, 16,603 unique transcripts and 102 proteins were identified. After enrichment analysis, we found that TIIA regulated genes are involved in carbohydrate metabolism, the cell cycle, apoptosis, DNA damage and cytoskeleton reorganization. Our proteomics data revealed the downregulation of intracellular ATP levels, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase and L-lactate dehydrogenase B chains by TIIA, which might work with disorders of glucose metabolism and extracellular lactate levels to suppress cell proliferation. The up-regulation of p53 and down-regulation of AKT was shown in TIIA- treated cells, which indicates the transformation of oncogenes. Severe DNA damage, cell cycle arrest at the G2/M transition and apoptosis with cytoskeleton reorganization were detected in TIIA-treated gastric cancer cells._x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_

Conclusions: Combining transcriptomics and proteomics results, we propose that TIIA treatment could lead cell stresses, including nutrient deficiency and DNA damage, by inhibiting the glucose metabolism of cancer cells. This study provides an insight into how the TIIA regulatory metabolism in gastric cancer cells suppresses cell growth, and may help improve the development of cancer therapy.","Abietanes, Cell Line, Tumor, Cell Proliferation, Drugs, Chinese Herbal, Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic, Glucose, Humans, Neoplasm Proteins, Proteomics, Stomach Neoplasms, Transcriptome",no,no,Unknown,yes,EA,25652794.0, Integrating transcriptomics and proteomics to show that tanshinone IIA suppresses cell growth by blocking glucose metabolism in gastric cancer cells ,yes,no,yes,ea,,False

The type I diabetes animal model in rats was established by fat emulsion and intraperitoneal injection with streptozotocin, in order to compare the hpyerglycemic and hypolipidemic effects of CR, RR and their combined administration of different ratio. The urinary metabolic profiling in rats of Coptidis Rhizoma and Rehmanniae Radix before and after the combined administration was analyzed by using the gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The differences among groups in metabolome were analyzed by the principal component analysis (PCA). The biochemical index results indicated that both CR and RR before and after the combined administration could lower high blood glucose, hypertriglyceride and high cholesterol. According to the analytical results of PCA of the rats' urine samples, the CR group was the most close to the normal group, with no significant difference in CR and RR group of different combination ratios. Twelve differentiated metabolites were identified to be related to type II diabetes. Compared with the normal group, the CR-treated group showed significant increase in seven differentiated metabolites. Among CR and RR drugs with different combination ratios, CR played a major role and thus acted as the monarch drug. Whereas RR served as the ministerial drug and assisted CR to show the efficacy. This study laid a foundation for the explanation of the combination mechanism of traditional Chinese medicines.","Animals, Blood Glucose, Coptis chinensis, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2, Drugs, Chinese Herbal, Male, Rats, Rats, Wistar, Rehmannia",no,yes,Unknown,yes,EA,24946561.0, Study on mechanism of combined administration of Coptidis Rhizoma and Rehmanniae Radix in treating type II diabetes mellitus ,yes,yes,yes,ea,,False

22667084,[Exploring the mechanism of rhizoma coptidis in treating type II diabetes mellitus based on metabolomics by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry],"Metabolomics was used to explore the mechanism of Rhizoma coptidis in treating type II diabetes mellitus. The rat model of type II diabetes mellitus was constructed by an injection of streptozocin (40 mg/kg), along with diets of fat emulsion. The rats were divided into four groups, the control group, the model group, the Rhizoma coptidis group (10 g/kg) and the metformin group (0.08 g/kg). After the treatment for 30 d, blood samples were collected to test biomedical indexes, and 24 h urine samples were collected for the metabolomics experiment. In the Rhizoma coptidis group, fasting blood glucose (FBG), total cholesterol (TC) and total plasma triglycerides (TG) were significantly decreased by 59.26%, 58.66% and 42.18%, respectively, compared with those in the model group. Based on gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, a urinary metabolomics method was used to study the mechanism of Rhizoma coptidis in treating diabetes mellitus. Based on the principal component analysis, it was found that the model group and control group were separated into two different clusters. The Rhizoma coptidis group was located between the model group and the control group, closer to the control group. Twelve significantly changed metabolites of diabetes mellitus were detected and identified, including 4-methyl phenol, benzoic acid, aminomalonic acid, and so on. After diabetic rats were administered with Rhizoma coptidis, 7 metabolites were significantly changed, and L-ascorbic acid and aminomalonic acid which related with the oxidative stress were significantly regulated to normal. The pharmacological results showed that Rhizoma coptidis could display anti-hyperglycemic and anti-hyperlipidemic effects. The Rhizoma coptidis had antioxidation function in preventing the occurrence of complications with diabetes mellitus to some extent.

18421265,Genome-wide linkage scan for the metabolic syndrome: the GENNID study,"In the United States, the metabolic syndrome (MetS) constitutes a major public health problem with over 47 million persons meeting clinical criteria for MetS. Numerous studies have suggested genetic susceptibility to MetS. The goals of this study were (i) to identify susceptibility loci for MetS in well-characterized families with type 2 diabetes (T2D) in four ethnic groups and (ii) to determine whether evidence for linkage varies across the four groups. The GENNID study (Genetics of NIDDM) is a multicenter study established by the American Diabetes Association in 1993 and comprises a comprehensive, well-characterized resource of T2D families from four ethnic groups (whites, Mexican Americans, African Americans, and Japanese Americans). Principal component factor analysis (PCFA) was used to define quantitative phenotypes of the MetS. Variance components linkage analysis was conducted using microsatellite markers from a 10-cM genome-wide linkage scan, separately in each of the four ethnic groups. Three quantitative MetS factors were identified by PCFA and used as phenotypes for MetS: (i) a weight/waist factor, (ii) a blood pressure factor, and (iii) a lipid factor. Evidence for linkage to each of these factors was observed. For each ethnic group, our results suggest that several regions harbor susceptibility genes for the MetS. The strongest evidence for linkage for MetS phenotypes was observed on chromosome 2 (2q12.1-2q13) in the white sample and on chromosome 3 (3q26.1-3q29) in the Mexican-American sample.

Methods: 16S-rDNA sequencing was performed to analyse the effects of DPP-4i and acarbose on the gut microbiota in mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD). Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from type 2 diabetes patients to germ-free mice was performed to investigate the contribution of the altered microbiome to antidiabetic effects of the drugs.

_x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_
Findings: Although DPP-4i and Î±-glucosidase inhibitor both altered the gut microbial composition, only the microbiome modulation of DPP-4i contributed to its hypoglycemic effect. Specifically, the changes of 68.6% genera induced by HFD were rescued by DPP-4i. FMT showed that the DPP-4i-altered microbiome improved glucose tolerance in colonized mice, while acarbose did not. Moreover, DPP-4i increased the abundance of Bacteroidetes, and also promoted a functional shift in the gut microbiome, especially increasing the production of succinate._x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_
_x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_
Interpretation: Our findings demonstrate an important effect of DPP-4i on the gut microbiota, revealing a new hypoglycemic mechanism and an additional benefit of it.

Whether these associations are consistent across ethnicities with a non-European ancestry is unknown. We analyzed 15 lipoprotein subfraction measures, on 1677 African-Americans (AAs), 1450 Hispanic-Americans (HAs), and 775 Chinese-Americans (CHN) participating in the multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis (MESA). Genome-wide data were obtained using the Affymetrix 6.0 and Illumina HumanOmni chips. Linear regression models between genetic variables and lipoprotein subfractions were adjusted for age, gender, body mass index, smoking, study center, and genetic ancestry (based on principal components), and additionally adjusted for Mexican/Non-Mexican status in HAs. A false discovery rate correction was applied separately within the results for each ethnicity to correct for multiple testing. Power calculations revealed that we did not have the power for SNP-based measures of association, so we analyzed phenotype-specific genetic risk scores (GRSs), constructed as in the original genome-wide analysis.

Several studies have identified a PDZ binding motif (PBM) at the carboxyl terminus of Tax-1 and demonstrated the importance of this domain for HTLV-1 induced cellular transformation. Using a mass spectrometry-based proteomics approach we identified sorting nexin 27 (SNX27) as a novel interacting partner of Tax-1. Further, we demonstrated that their interaction is mediated by the Tax-1 PBM and SNX27 PDZ domains. SNX27 has been shown to promote the plasma membrane localization of glucose transport 1 (GLUT1), one of the receptor molecules of the HTLV-1 virus, and the receptor molecule required for HTLV-1 fusion and entry. We postulated that Tax-1 alters GLUT1 localization via its interaction with SNX27. We demonstrate that over expression of Tax-1 in cells causes a reduction of GLUT1 on the plasma membrane. Furthermore, we show that knockdown of SNX27 results in increased virion release and decreased HTLV-1 infectivity. Collectively, we demonstrate the first known mechanism by which HTLV-1 regulates a receptor molecule post-infection.","Amino Acid Sequence, Gene Knockdown Techniques, Gene Products, tax, Glucose Transporter Type 1, HEK293 Cells, HTLV-I Infections, Host Microbial Interactions, Human T-lymphotropic virus 1, Humans, Models, Biological, PDZ Domains, Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs, Receptors, Virus, Sorting Nexins, Virulence, gag Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus",yes,no,ea,yes,EA,30897179.0," HTLV-1 Tax-1 interacts with SNX27 to regulate cellular localization of the HTLV-1 receptor molecule, GLUT1 ",no,no,yes,Unknown,,False
32229157,Practical Strategies Against the Novel Coronavirus and COVID-19-the Imminent Global Threat,"The last month of 2019 harbingered the emergence of a viral outbreak that is now a major public threat globally. COVID-19 was first diagnosed and confirmed in a couple of cases with unknown pneumonia; the patients lived in, or travelled to, Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei province. People now face a complex challenge that deserves urgent intervention by all involved in medical healthcare globally. Conventional antiviral therapies or vaccines are the most referred means of tackling the virus, but we think establishing these ideal management strategies is presently far-fetched. In-house isolation or quarantine of suspected cases to keep hospital admissions manageable and prevent in-hospital spread of the virus, and promoting general awareness about transmission routes are the practical strategies used to tackle the spread of COVID-19. Cases with weakened or compromised immune systems-for example, elderly individuals, young children, and those with pre-existing conditions such as diabetes, cancer, hypertension, and chronic respiratory diseases-are particularly more susceptible to COVID-19. Hopefully, cumulative data using whole-genome sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 genome in parallel with mathematical modeling will help the molecular biologists to understand unknown features of the pathogenesis and epidemiology of COVID-19.",,no,no,Unknown,yes,EA,32229157.0, Practical Strategies Against the Novel Coronavirus and COVID-19-the Imminent Global Threat ,no,no,no,ea,,False
9528332,[The recent progress and future prospects of diagnostic DNA testing--experience in DNA analysis of serum enzymes],"Rapid progress in the molecular technology has stimulated attempts to establish DNA diagnosis of human diseases. However, advances in technology have led to improvements at the research level but not in routine laboratory work because only few laboratory tests are covered by medical insurance; the methodologies cannot be easily applied to routine work; and the equipment and reagents are relatively expensive. This paper provides an overview of recent progress in DNA diagnosis and my experience in the DNA diagnostic field. I started working in the DNA diagnostic field in January 1988 with research on mutation analysis of lactate dehydrogenase subunit deficiency. I worked in Dr. Steven Li's laboratory at the National Institutes of Health in North Carolina and discussed with him about screening the patient's genomic library instead of using PCR because PCR was not adequate for mutation analysis. We successfully completed the mutation analysis and I returned to Japan. Thereafter, PCR has been increasingly improved and is now applicable to mutation analysis. Currently, amplification is essential for many DNA diagnostic technologies. The Human Genome Project has progressed and will be finished around 2002. In this process, DNA diagnosis will play an important role in the clinical laboratory. Common diseases, such as atherosclerosis, diabetes mellitus, hypertension and so on, have also been analyzed and the responsible genes will have been identified. Each laboratory should have a specialty and characteristic, and should be ready to help and assist each other via a network. Network communication is clearly needed by laboratories in the future.","Arteriosclerosis, Cholinesterases, DNA, Diabetes Mellitus, Forecasting, Genetic Diseases, Inborn, Genetic Techniques, Humans, Hypertension, L-Lactate Dehydrogenase, Mutation, Polymerase Chain Reaction",yes,yes,ea,no,EA,9528332.0, The recent progress and future prospects of diagnostic DNA...,yes,yes,no,Unknown,,False

The objective of this research was to screen GABA levels, antioxidant activities and bioactive compounds in brown rice. In this study, we first fermented brown rice with different lactic acid bacteria (LABs), and the best LAB was selected based on the levels of GABA in the fermentate. Lactobacillus reuterii generated the highest levels of GABA after fermentation. To ascertain whether germination can improve the GABA levels of brown rice, we compared the levels of GABA in raw brown rice (Raw), germinated brown rice (Germ), fermented brown rice (Ferm) and fermented-germinated brown rice (G+F) to identify the best approach. Then, antioxidant activities were investigated for Raw BR, Germ BR, Ferm BR and G+F BR. Antioxidant activity was calculated using a 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl hydrazile radical assay, 2,2-azino-bis-(3-ethylene benzothiozoline-6-sulfonic acid) radical assay and ferric-reducing antioxidant power. In Ferm BR, DPPH (114.40 Â± 0.66), ABTS (130.52 Â± 0.97) and FRAP (111.16 Â± 1.83) mg Trolox equivalent 100 g, dry weight (DW), were observed as the highest among all samples. Total phenolic content (97.13 Â± 0.59) and total flavonoids contents (79.62 Â± 1.33) mg GAE/100 g and catechin equivalent/100 g, DW, were also found to be highest in fermented BR. Furthermore, an untargeted metabolomics approach using ultra-high-performance liquid tandem chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry revealed the abundance of bioactive compounds in fermented BR, such as GABA, tryptophan, coumaric acid, L-ascorbic acid, linoleic acid, Î²-carotenol, eugenol, 6-gingerol, etc., as well as bioactive peptides which could contribute to the health-promoting properties of L. reuterii fermented brown rice.",,no,no,Unknown,yes,EA,33921826.0, Untargeted Metabolomics of Korean Fermented Brown Rice Using UHPLC Q-TOF MS/MS Reveal an Abundance of Potential Dietary Antioxidative and Stress-Reducing Compounds ,yes,no,yes,ea,,False

21168233,"HNF1 alpha gene coding regions mutations screening, in a Caucasian population clinically characterized as MODY from Argentina","There are at least six subtypes of Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY) with distinctive genetic causes. MODY 3 is caused by mutations in HNF1A gene, an insulin transcription factor, so mutations in this gene are associated with impaired insulin secretion. MODY 3 prevalence differs according to the population analyzed, but it is one of the most frequent subtypes. Therefore, our aims in this work were to find mutations present in the HNF1A gene and provide information on their prevalence.Mutations screening was done in a group of 80 unrelated patients (average age 17.1 years) selected by clinical characterization of MODY, by SSCP electrophoresis followed by sequenciation.We found eight mutations, of which six were novel and four sequence variants, which were all novel. Therefore the prevalence of MODY 3 in this group was 10%. Compared clinical data between the non-MODY 3 patients and the MODY 3 diagnosed patients did not show any significant difference.Eight patients were diagnosed as MODY 3 and new data about the prevalence of that subtype is provided. Our results contribute to reveal novel mutations, providing new data about the prevalence of that subtype.Copyright Â© 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The phytochemical-rich samples of the aerial parts of Minthostachys diffusa Epling. were tested for pharmacological and health-promoting bioactivities using in vitro chemical and enzymatic assays. A range of radical scavenging activities of the samples against biological radicals such as nitric oxide and superoxide anion and against synthetic 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl and 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) radicals, the ferric reducing antioxidant power and the lipid peroxidation inhibition were determined and ranked using the 'relative antioxidant capacity index' (RACI). The ethyl acetate fraction showed the highest RACI of +1.12. Analysis of the various fractions' inhibitory ability against enzymes involved in diabetes (Î±-amylase and Î±-glucosidase), and against enzymes associated with Parkinson's or Alzheimer's diseases (acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase) also suggested that the ethyl acetate fraction was the most active. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis of the ethyl acetate fraction showed more than 30 polyphenolic compounds, including triterpenes. The inhibitory cholinesterase effects of the triterpenes identified from M. diffusa were further analysed by in silico docking of these compounds into 3D-structures of acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase.

Little is known, however, about whether alterations in LDL size are associated with the apoE4 phenotype. LDL size was determined by gradient gel electrophoresis, and apoE phenotype was determined by isoelectric focus in 337 nondiabetic subjects from the San Antonio Heart Study, a population-based study of diabetes and cardiovascular risk factors in Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic whites. ApoE4 was associated not only with increases in LDL cholesterol concentrations but also with decreased LDL size. After adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio, triglyceride, HDL cholesterol, fasting insulin, and diabetic status, the apoE phenotype remained significantly related to LDL size (A) in both men (apoE23, 260.0; apoE33; 256.3; and apoE34, 252.6; P = .01) and women (apoE23, 261.7; apoE33, 257.9; and apoE34, 256.7, P = .045).

15880269,The future of pediatric nephrology,"The delineation of renal disease in children dates to the 1880s with descriptions of Henoch's purpura, bladder exstrophy, renal rickets and nephritis. The discipline of pediatric nephrology mainly emerged during the 20th century in response to problems in fluid and electrolyte balance, characterization of the nephrotic syndrome, use of renal biopsy, antibiotic therapy of urinary tract infections, dialysis and transplantation in children, growth problems associated with chronic renal failure, detection and therapy of hypertension, and the creation of both national and international pediatric nephrology societies and a journal now in its 18th year. The development of molecular and cell biology, genetic and genomic techniques and bioinformatics methods underlie many future directions. We should anticipate further elucidation of single gene disorders, of complex trait analysis of disorders, such as diabetic nephropathy and hypertension, the interplay of developmental genes and gene products and interactions within the podocyte. Specific therapies directed against inflammation, vascular damage, cyst development, the ravages of proteinuria and graft rejection (or induction leading to tolerance) will be developed. Stem cell therapies may replace lost renal mass, even of specific nephron sites. Novel therapies will also modulate the cell cycle, tyrosine kinase signaling and apoptosis. In addition, drugs will be specifically tested in children for many renal conditions. Larger and more specialized registries will be developed; epidemiologic studies and exploration of large data sets will lead to clinical guidelines that are evidenced-based. There is a need for more careful measurement of glomerular filtration rate (GFR), proteinuria and cytokines, and a fuller appreciation of the nutritional and hormonal role of the kidney. Finally, the antecedents of adult renal disease and the need to intervene in a proactive fashion will be realized. Despite these impressive advances in care, the greatest challenges will be in providing children with renal disease access to well-trained pediatric nephrologists, especially in Asia (1 billion children), Africa, Central and South America, and in immigrant and refugee populations. Included in this challenge is the capacity to have affordable access to use of contemporary techniques, and effective medications and prevention strategies. The International Pediatric Nephrology Association (IPNA), its journal, and pediatric advocates will need to use their energies to take on these challenges.","Child, Computational Biology, Humans, Internationality, Kidney Diseases, Nephrology, Pediatrics, Societies, Medical",no,no,unk,no,LAaC,15880269.0, The future of pediatric nephrology ,yes,no,no,Unknown,,False
23085272,MODY 2: mutation identification and molecular ancestry in a Brazilian family,"Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY) is a heterogeneous group of genetic diseases characterized by a primary defect in insulin secretion and hyperglycemia, non-ketotic disease, monogenic autosomal dominant mode of inheritance, age at onset less than 25 years, and lack of auto-antibodies. It accounts for 2-5% of all cases of non-type 1 diabetes. MODY subtype 2 is caused by mutations in the glucokinase (GCK) gene. In this study, we sequenced the GCK gene of two volunteers with clinical diagnosis for MODY2 and we were able to identify four mutations including one for a premature stop codon (c.76C>T). Based on these results, we have developed a specific PCR-RFLP assay to detect this mutation and tested 122 related volunteers from the same family. This mutation in the GCK gene was detected in 21 additional subjects who also had the clinical features of this genetic disease. In conclusion, we identified new GCK gene mutations in a Brazilian family of Italian descendance, with one due to a premature stop codon located in the second exon of the gene. We also developed a specific assay that is fast, cheap and reliable to detect this mutation. Finally, we built a molecular ancestry model based on our results for the migration of individuals carrying this genetic mutation from Northern Italy to Brazil.","Adult, Brazil, Child, Codon, Terminator, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2, Emigration and Immigration, Exons, Female, Glucokinase, Humans, Italy, Male, Models, Genetic, Mutation, Polymerase Chain Reaction, Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length",yes,yes,lac,yes,LAaC,23085272.0, MODY 2: mutation identification and molecular ancestry in a Brazilian family ,yes,yes,yes,we,,False

However, common variants identified by genome wide association studies (GWAS) explain only about 10% of the total trait variance for T2D and less than 5% of the variance for obesity, indicating that a large proportion of heritability is still unexplained. The transcriptomic approach described here uses quantitative gene expression and disease-related physiological data (deep phenotyping) to measure the direct correlation between the expression of specific genes and physiological traits. Transcriptomic analysis bridges the gulf between GWAS and physiological studies. Recent GWAS studies have utilized very large population samples, numbering in the tens of thousands (or even hundreds of thousands) of individuals, yet establishing causal functional relationships between strongly associated genetic variants and disease remains elusive.

14660699,Population genetics and geographic variation of alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) paralogs and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6pd) in Drosophila mojavensis,"Populations of Drosophila mojavensis from the deserts of the Baja California peninsula and mainland Mexico utilize different cactus hosts with different alcohol contents. The enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) has been proposed to play an important role in the adaptation of Drosophila species to their environment. This study investigates the role of ADH in the adaptation of the cactophilic D. mojavensis to its cactus host. In D. mojavensis and its sibling species, D. arizonae, the Adh gene has duplicated, giving rise to a larval/ovarian form (Adh-1) and an adult form (Adh-2). Studies of sequence variation presented here indicate that the Adh paralogs have followed different evolutionary trajectories. Adh-1 exhibits an excess of fixed amino acid replacements, suggesting adaptive evolution, which could have been a result of several host shifts that occurred during the divergence of D. mojavensis. A 17-bp intron haplotype polymorphism segregates in Adh-2 and has markedly different frequencies in the Baja and mainland populations. The presence of the intron polymorphism suggests possible selection for the maintenance of pre-mRNA structure. Finally, this study supports the proposed Baja California origination of D. mojavensis and subsequent colonization of the mainland accompanied by a host shift.","Alcohol Dehydrogenase, Alleles, Animals, Base Sequence, California, Drosophila, Drosophila Proteins, Genes, Insect, Genetic Variation, Genetics, Population, Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase, Mexico, Molecular Sequence Data, Mutation, Phylogeny, Sequence Alignment",yes,no,lac,yes,LAaC,14660699.0, Population genetics and geographic variation of alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) paralogs and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6pd) in Drosophila mojavensis ,no,no,yes,none,,False
29393974,Contrasting metabolic profiles of tasty Andean varieties of tomato fruit in comparison with commercial ones,"The fruits of most commercial tomato cultivars (Solanum lycopersicum L.) are deficient in flavour. In contrast, traditional 'criollo' tomato varieties are appreciated for fruit of excellent organoleptic quality. Small farmers from the Andean valleys in Argentina have maintained their own tomato varieties, which were selected mainly for flavour. This work aims to correlate the chemical composition of the fruit with the sensory attributes of eight heirloom tomato varieties. The long-term goal is to identify potential candidate genes capable of altering the chemicals involved in flavour.A sensory analysis was conducted and the metabolomics of fruit were determined. The data revealed that defined tomato aroma and sourness correlated with citrate and several volatile organic compounds (VOC), such as α-terpineol, p-menth-1-en-9-al, linalool and 3,6-dimethyl-2,3,3a,4,5,7a-hexahydrobenzofuran (DMHEX), a novel volatile recently identified in tomato. Two sensory attributes - sweetness and a not-acidic taste - correlated with the characteristic tomato taste, and also with fructose, glucose, and two VOCs, benzaldehyde, and 2-methyl-2-octen-4-one.These data provide new evidence of the complex chemical combination that induced the flavour and aroma of the good-tasting 'criollo' tomato fruit. That is, the compounds that correlated with defined tomato aroma and acidic taste did not correlate with sweetness, or with characteristic tomato taste. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.© 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.","Adult, Argentina, Carotenoids, Female, Flavoring Agents, Fruit, Humans, Male, Metabolome, Middle Aged, Odorants, Solanum lycopersicum, Taste, Volatile Organic Compounds, Young Adult",no,no,Unknown,yes,LAaC,29393974.0, Contrasting metabolic profiles of tasty Andean varieties of tomato fruit in comparison with commercial ones ,no,no,yes,lac,,False

The objectives for this prospective cross-sectional study were to determine allele frequencies for NPC1 polymorphisms (644A>G, 1926C>G, 2572A>G, and 3797G>A) and association with metabolic disease phenotypes in an ethnically diverse New Mexican obstetric population. Allele frequencies for 1926C>G, 2572A>G, and 3797G>A were significantly different between race/ethnic groups (non-Hispanic white, Hispanic, and Native American). The results also indicated a significant pairwise linkage-disequilibrium between each of the four NPC1 polymorphisms in race/ethnic groups. Moreover, the derived and major allele for 1926C>G was associated (OR 2.11, 95% CI 1.10-3.96, P = 0.022) with increased risk for maternal prepregnancy overweight (BMI 25.0-29.9kg/m2) while the ancestral and major allele for 2572A>G was associated (OR 4.68, 95% CI 1.23-17.8, P = 0.024) with increased risk for gestational diabetes in non-Hispanic whites, but not Hispanics or Native Americans.

29808448,Transcriptome analysis supports viral infection and fluoride toxicity as contributors to chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology (CKDu) in Sri Lanka,"Chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology (CKDu), having epidemic characteristics, is being diagnosed increasingly in certain tropical regions of the world, mainly Latin America and Sri Lanka. They have been observed primarily in farming communities and current hypotheses point toward many environmental and occupational triggers. CKDu does not have common etiologies of chronic kidney disease (CKD) such as hypertension, diabetes, or autoimmune disease. We aimed to understand the molecular processes underlying CKDu in Sri Lanka using transcriptome analysis.RNA extracted from whole blood was reverse transcribed and used for microarray analysis using the Human HT-12 v.4 array (Illumina). Pathway analysis was carried out using ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA-Qiagen). Microarray results were validated using real-time PCR of five selected genes.Pathways related to innate immune response, including interferon signaling, inflammasome signaling and TREM1 signaling had the most significant positive activation z scores, where as EIF2 signaling and mTOR signaling had the most significant negative activation z scores. Pathways previously linked to fluoride toxicity; G-protein activation, Cdc42 signaling, Rac signaling and RhoA signaling were activated in CKDu patients. The most significantly activated biological functions were cell death, cell movement and antimicrobial response. Significant toxicological functions were mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress and apoptosis.Based on the molecular pathway analysis in CKDu patients and review of literature, viral infections and fluoride toxicity appear to be contributing to the molecular mechanisms underlying CKDu.","Adult, Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-2, Fluorides, GTP-Binding Proteins, Gene Expression Profiling, Humans, Immunity, Innate, Inflammasomes, Interferons, Middle Aged, Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis, RNA, Renal Insufficiency, Chronic, Signal Transduction, Sri Lanka, TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases, Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid Cells-1, Virus Diseases, cdc42 GTP-Binding Protein, rac GTP-Binding Proteins, rhoA GTP-Binding Protein",yes,no,lac,yes,LAaC,29808448.0, Transcriptome analysis supports viral infection and fluoride toxicity as contributors to chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology (CKDu) in Sri Lanka ,yes,no,yes,sa,,False

We (1) estimated the heritability of stroke in this population using genomic-relatedness matrix-restricted maximum likelihood approaches, (2) assessed loci associated with stroke in Europeans in our population, and (3) evaluated the influence of genetic factors underlying cardiovascular risk factors on stroke using polygenic risk scoring.Our results indicate a substantial genetic contribution to stroke risk in African ancestry populations (h2 = 0.35 [SE = 0.19], p = 0.043). Polygenic risk scores indicate that cardiovascular risk scores contribute to the genetic liability (odds ratio [OR] 1.09 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-1.17], p = 0.029) and point to a strong influence of type 2 diabetes in large vessel stroke (OR 1.62 [95% CI 1.19-2.22], p = 0.0024). Single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with ischemic stroke in Europeans shared direction of effect in SLESS (p = 0.031), suggesting that disease mechanisms are shared across ancestries.Stroke in African ancestry populations is highly heritable and influenced by genetic determinants underlying cardiovascular risk factors.

16969381,Effects of hazelnut-enriched diet on plasma cholesterol and lipoprotein profiles in hypercholesterolemic adult men,"Frequent consumption of nuts is associated with favorable plasma lipid profiles and reduced risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). This study was conducted to investigate the effects of hazelnut-enriched diet on plasma cholesterol and lipoprotein profiles in hypercholesterolemic adult men compared with baseline and control diet, and also to measure the anthropometric parameters, habitual physical activities, nutrient intake and endothelial function.Fifteen hypercholesterolemic men aged 48+/-8 years were recruited voluntarily. A well-controlled, 2-period (P1 and P2) study design with a total of 8-week was implemented. In the P1, subjects consumed a control diet (low-fat, low-cholesterol and high-carbohydrate). During the P2, the control diet was supplemented with MUFA-rich hazelnut (40 g/day), which provided 11.6% of total energy content. Anthropometric parameters and habitual physical activities were recorded. Plasma total and HDL cholesterol, TAG, ApoA-1, Apo B, total homocysteine and glucose concentrations were measured. All parameters and measurements were obtained at baseline and end of each 4-week diet period.Body weights of subjects remained stable throughout the study. Compared with baseline, the hazelnut-enriched diet decreased (P<0.05) the concentrations of VLDL cholesterol, triacylglycerol, apolipoprotein B by 29.5, 31.8, and 9.2%, respectively, while increasing HDL cholesterol concentrations by 12.6%. Total/HDL cholesterol and LDL/HDL cholesterol ratios favorably decreased (P<0.05). Although insignificant there was a decreasing trend for the rest of parameters, particularly in total (5.2%) and LDL cholesterol (3.3%) in subjects consuming a hazelnut-enriched diet compared to that of the baseline. No changes were found in fasting levels of glucose, Apo A-1 and homocysteine between the control and hazelnut-enriched diets.This study demonstrated that a high-fat and high-MUFA-rich hazelnut diet was superior to a low-fat control diet because of favorable changes in plasma lipid profiles of hypercholesterolemic adult men and, thereby positively affecting the CHD risk profile.Funding provided by a grant from the Hazelnut Promotion Group, Giresun, Turkey.","Anthropometry, Apolipoproteins B, Cholesterol, Cholesterol, HDL, Cholesterol, LDL, Cholesterol, VLDL, Corylus, Cross-Over Studies, Dietary Fats, Dietary Fats, Unsaturated, Endothelial Cells, Exercise, Homocysteine, Humans, Hypercholesterolemia, Male, Middle Aged, Treatment Outcome, Triglycerides",no,no,mena,yes,MEaNA,16969381.0, Effects of hazelnut-enriched diet on plasma cholesterol and lipoprotein profiles in hypercholesterolemic adult men ,no,no,yes,cee,,False

It is one of the leading causes of death in industrialized nations. Oxidative modification of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) in the arterial wall plays an important role in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis. Paraoxonase1 (PON1) is involved in lipid metabolism and is believed to protect LDL oxidation. In our study, we aimed to clarify the relationship between PON1 gene L55M polymorphism and the extent and severity of CAD.In total, 114 patients (54 males, mean age: 56.7 Â± 12.0 years; 60 females, mean age: 55.7 Â± 13.2 years) with stable angina or angina equivalent symptoms were enrolled in this prospective study. Cardiological evaluation was performed with electrocardiogram and transthoracic echocardiogram. The presence of hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, and smoking status were ascertained. The patients were grouped according to their Gensini scores and gender. Genetic analysis of the PON1 gene L55M polymorphism was performed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism.We determined that the LL genotype was more prevalent in patients with Gensini score higher than or equal to 20 (p=0.026) and that this correlated with severe atherosclerotic coronary artery lesions in both gender groups, reaching a statistical significance in the female subjects (p=0.038).It was thought that the PON1 gene L55M polymorphism plays a significant role in CAD progression, especially in females.","Aryldialkylphosphatase, Coronary Artery Disease, Electrocardiography, Female, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Polymorphism, Genetic, Prospective Studies, Risk Factors, Severity of Illness Index, Sex Factors, Turkey, White People",yes,no,mena,yes,MEaNA,26467378.0, The association of paraoxonase 1 gene L55M polymorphism with the extent and severity of coronary artery disease in the Turkish population and its dependence on gender ,yes,no,yes,cee,,False

NAFLD encompasses a spectrum of severity, ranging from simple steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and fibrosis, increasing the risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Importantly, NAFLD is closely linked to obesity and tightly interrelated with insulin resistance and T2DM. T2DM and NAFLD (T2DM-NAFLD) are called as the Xike Rixijing Disease and Tonglaga Indigestion Disease respectively, in Mongolian medicine. Xike Rixijing Disease maybe develop into Tonglaga Indigestion Disease. Forturnately many Mongolian medicines show efficient treatment of T2DM-NAFLD, such as Agriophyllum squarrosum, Haliyasu (dried powder of camel placenta), Digeda-4 (herbs of Lomatogonium carinthiacum, rhizomata of Coptis chinensis, ripe fruits of Gardenia jasminoides, herbs of Dianthus superbus), Guangmingyan Siwei Decoction Powder (Halite, ripe fruits of Terminalia chebula, rhizomata of Zingiber officinale, fruit clusters of Piper longum), Tonglaga-5 (ripe fruits of Punica granatum, barks of Cinnamomum cassia, ripe fruits of Amomum kravanh, fruit clusters of Piper longum, flowers of Carthamus tinctorius), Tegexidegeqi (rhizomata of Inula helenium, ripe fruits of Gardenia jasminoides, rhizomata of Platycodon grandiflorum, rhizomata of Coptis chinensis, heartwood of Caesalpinia sappan), Ligan Shiliu Bawei San (ripe fruits of Punica granatum, barks of Cinnamomum cassia, ripe fruits of Amomum kravanh, fruit clusters of Piper longum, flowers of Carthamus tinctorius, ripe fruits of Amomum tsao-ko, rhizomata of Zingiber officinale), etc. Principles of Mongolian medicine in treating diseases: by balancing ""three essences or roots"" and ""seven elements"", strengthening liver and kidney function, transporting nutrients to enhance physical strength and disease resistance, and combined with drugs for comprehensive conditioning treatment. However, their molecular mechanisms remain unclear.

Methods After Institutional Review Board approval, a sample of 877 Armenian Americans was collected for 5 consecutive years (2011-2015) at a health fair. Collected data included: sociodemographic variables; cardiometabolic data, including systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure, glucose (Glu), and lipids; anthropometric data, including height (Ht), weight (Wt), body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and hip circumference (HC). Retrospective descriptive correlation, test of significance, and logistic regression analyses were performed. Results Findings showed that about 50% of the participants had abnormal waist/hip ratio and approximately one-quarter of the subjects had glucose levels that were indicative of high risk for DM. Logistic regression analysis revealed that high SBP ( P = .04), above normal WC ( P = .03), and high triglycerides ( P = .04) were significant in predicting DM. Moreover, age ( P =.0001), family history of cardiovascular disease ( P= .01), and above normal WC ( P = .04) were found to be significant predictors of HTN. Conclusion Waist circumference indicated to be a strong predictor for DM and HTN. Early detection and timely interventions are important to prevent DM and HTN and their associated complications.

35432754,Functional annotation and enrichment analysis of differentially expressed serum proteins in patients with type 2 diabetes after dapagliflozin,"Only 50% of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) can control their blood glucose levels. Dapagliflozin is a selective inhibitor of sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT-2) that improves the insulin sensitivity of the liver and peripheral tissues. Many studies confirmed that SGLT2 inhibitors reduce blood glucose and have multiple beneficial effects such as weight loss, lipid regulation, and kidney protection. Nevertheless, the mechanisms of the renal and cardiovascular protective effects of dapagliflozin from the perspective of differentially expressed proteins in the serum of T2DM patients have not been intensively explored so far.To identify differentially expressed proteins associated with dapagliflozin treatment in patients with T2DM.Twenty T2DM patients [hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) 7.0%-10.0%] were enrolled at The Affiliated Hospital of Inner Mongolia Medical University between January 1, 2017 and December 1, 2018. They received dapagliflozin (10 mg/d) for 3 mo, and the HbA1c < 7.0% target was achieved. The changes in clinical indexes were compared before and after treatments. Label-free quantitative proteomics was used to identify differentially expressed proteins using the serum samples of five patients. The identified differentially expressed proteins were analyzed using various bioinformatics tools.Dapagliflozin significantly improved the clinical manifestation of the patients. There were 18 downregulated proteins and one upregulated protein in the serum samples of patients after dapagliflozin administration. Bioinformatics analyses, including subcellular localization, EuKaryotic Orthologous Groups, Gene Ontology, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes annotations, were used to profile the biological characteristics of the 19 differentially expressed proteins. Based on the literature and function enrichment analysis, two downregulated proteins, myeloperoxidase (MPO) and alpha II B integrin (ITGA2B), and one upregulated protein, podocalyxin (PCX), were selected for enzyme linked immunosorbent assay validation. These validated differentially expressed proteins had multiple correlations with clinical indexes, including HbAc1 and fasting C-peptide.Dapagliflozin has hypoglycemic effects and regulates the serum expressions of MPO, ITGA2B, and PCX, possibly contributing to the effects of dapagliflozin on oxidative stress, insulin resistance, and lipid metabolism.Â©The Author(s) 2022.

34258921,"Prevalence and treatment of high cardiovascular disease risk in Inner Mongolia, China","Early identification of individuals with high risk is crucial to preventing cardiovascular disease (CVD). We aimed to determine the prevalence of high CVD risk in Inner Mongolia and to analyze the treatment of major risk factors among individuals with high CVD risk. We selected 70,380 participants aged 35-75 years in Inner Mongolia between 2015 and 2017 using multistage stratified sampling. All participants completed a questionnaire and their blood pressure, blood glucose and lipid levels, height, weight and waist circumference were measured. Participants without a history of CVD were defined as high CVD risk if the predicted 10-year risk for CVD exceeded 10%. We assessed rates of high CVD risk and the prevalence and treatment of major risk factors among individuals with high CVD risk. After excluding participants with previous CVD, 68,083 participants remained. The overall prevalence of high CVD risk was 24.96%. The age- and sex-standardized rate of high CVD risk was 22.92%. Among high-risk participants, the prevalence of risk factors was hypertension (91.9%), dyslipidemia (54.1%), obesity (34.6%), diabetes (27.6%), and smoking (24.5%); clustering of these risk factors was common. The percentage of high-risk individuals taking antihypertensive drugs was 45.94% in those with hypertension; 27.99% of those with diabetes took hypoglycemic drugs and only 5.01% of those with dyslipidemia took lipid-lowering drugs. Control rates of hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia were 1.20%, 4.43%, and 2.78%, respectively. Therefore, the prevalence of high CVD risk was elevated in Inner Mongolia, and treatment and control rates were low.Â© 2021 The Author(s).

25062420,Intervention for prehypertension and its cardiovascular risk factors in Inner Mongolia,"Blood pressure levels were evaluated among prehypertension patients with associated cardiovascular risk factors to determine the effect of different interventions with respect to new endpoint events. A total of 1112 patients were equally and randomly divided into control, lifestyle, drug, and lifestyle + drug groups, and were followed-up for 12 months. We collected the age, height, weight, blood pressure, heart rate, blood lipid levels, blood glucose levels, and other clinical data from all subjects at the baseline and at the end of the follow-up period. The average systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in the intervention groups were significantly reduced after the intervention (lifestyle + drug > drug > lifestyle). SBP and DBP were higher in the control group than before intervention (P < 0.05). Age, gender, heart rate, triglyceride (TG) levels, body mass index (BMI), alcohol consumption, and family history were the major factors affecting blood pressure. Increased BMI, TG, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, alcohol consumption, family history, SBP, and DBP were major risk factors of hypertension. At the end of the follow-up period, there were 67 cases of hypertension, 32 cases of diabetes, and 12 cases of the endpoint events. Hypertension and diabetes events were reduced in the intervention groups relative to the control group (P < 0.05). The number of cases with incident cardiovascular endpoints did not differ among the three intervention groups (P > 0.05).

(IB), which is native to China and Mongolia, is used as a traditional medicine for conditions such as inflammation, cancer, and bacterial infections. However, the effects of Iris bungei Maxim. on adipocyte differentiation have not been studied. In the present study, we first demonstrated the molecular mechanisms underlying the adipogenic activity of the methanol extract of Mongolian I. bungei Maxim. (IB). IB significantly enhanced intracellular lipid accumulation and adipocyte differentiation in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, IB markedly stimulated the expression of genes related to adipogenesis such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor Î³, adiponectin, and aP2. In addition, we also observed that IB induces lipogenic genes such as fatty acid synthase, sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c, stearoyl-CoA desaturase, and acetyl-CoA carboxylase. Interestingly IB regulated adipocyte differentiation in both the early and middle stages. Taken together, these adipogenic and lipogenic effects of IB suggest its efficacy for the prevention and/or treatment of type 2 diabetes._x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_

According to the literatures collected, Cymbaria component database was established to define important active ingredients and key targets for the anti-hyperglycemic effect to predict action mechanism by active ingredient screening and target prediction techniques. Molecular docking predicted binding activity of main active components with key targets in Cymbaria, then verified the action mechanism in vitro. The Cymbaria component database contained 177 chemical components, 90 chemical structures were confirmed, including 34 chemical components with effective targets. According to the prediction results from network pharmacology, 61 biological processes were significantly affected, such as fatty acid metabolism including PPARs signaling pathway, protein kinase activity and insulin signal pathway. Moreover, the key target proteins were Akt1 and TNFÎ± and quercetin, luteolin and catalpol were the main active ingredients of Cymbaria. Molecular docking prediction showed that luteolin, quercetin and catalpol had a strong binding activity with Akt1; luteolin had strong binding activity but quercetin and catalpol had a certain binding activity with TNFÎ±. Furthermore, catalpol showed hypoglycemic effects in vitro, which up-regulated p-Akt(Ser473)/Akt, PPARÎ± and PPARÎ´ levels and reduced FABP4 expression to regulate glycose and lipid metabolism for improving insulin sensitivity.

The level of glycated hemoglobin (Hb(1)A(c)) was determined as the biochemical marker. Parameters of the LPO intensity - malondialdehyde and dien conjugates, antioxidant system parameters - SOD, GSH and ceruloplasmin, immune parameters - IgA, M, G, CIC and phagocytic activity were determined in all groups of patients including the control group.Amounts of MDA and DC increased at all stages of the disease. In contrast, decreases in antioxidant system parameters - SOD, GSH and ceruloplasmin were observed. The oxidative stress increase resulted in the decline of phagocytic activity in the three groups by 23%, 29% and 52%, respectively. Amounts of T-lymphocytes were also decreased by 9.8%, 28% and 32%. But CIC were observed to increase.Intensification of the oxidative stress and the decrease in the antioxidant system protective function stimulate alterations in immune system parameters - amounts of immunoglobulins and immune complexes increased and phagocytic activity decreased. It suggests that the level of the oxidative stress effect on the alterations in immune parameters directly depends on the stage of the disease.Copyright Â© 2012 Diabetes India.

In China, five adult probands and one child proband with HNF1B-associated disease had been reported, whereas few fetuses are described. The aims of this retrospective study were to understand about the clinical manifestations of HNF1B-associated disease and to further improve the recognition of this disorder. Method: Four patients (3 males, 1 female) and three fetuses with HNF1B mutations were included in this study. They were admitted to our hospital from January 2013 to March 2017. HNF1B mutations were detected using targeted next generation sequencing and quantitative real-time PCR or Sanger sequencing. HNF1B heterozygous deletion of exons 1-9 was found in 4 patients and 2 fetuses, and HNF1B heterozygous missense mutation in 1 fetus. These two mutations had been reported. Two patients and 1 fetus had de novo mutations. Results of renal ultrasonography with or without magnetic resonance imaging, biochemical investigations, urine routine examination and other necessary investigations in 7 cases were analyzed. Result: Three patients were Han Chinese ethnicity, and one patient was Mongolian. In patients 1 and 4, abnormal fetal kidneys were discovered by routine ultrasonography, and the age at first feature identified in Patients 2 and 3 were 13 years and 28 years. Patient 3 had normal renal function and the remainder had reduced glomerular filtration rate. In addition, patient 4 presented with nephrotic syndrome and glycosuria, patient 2 with early onset hyperparathyroidism and renal osteodystrophy, and patient 3 with diabetes mellitus. All the 4 patients had renal structural abnormalities including bilateral multiple renal cysts, dysplasia and hyperechogenic kidneys. Only patient 3 had a positive family history of renal diseases, the remainder had a negative family history of renal diseases. In 3 fetuses, prenatal ultrasound anomalies were detected during the second trimester. These 3 fetuses had hyperechogenic kidneys with or without renal cysts. Polyhydramnios was detected in only one of the 3 fetuses. Two of the 3 fetuses had a positive family history of renal diseases. Conclusion: Clinical phenotypes of HNF1B-related disease are heterogeneous, renal malformations clearly appear to be the most common manifestation, multiple renal cysts are characteristic, and patients can progress to impaired kidney function during childhood; HNF1B mutation is a differential diagnosis of fetal hyperechogenic kidneys or multiple renal cysts.","Adult, Child, China, Female, Genes, Homeobox, Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 1, Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 1-beta, Humans, Kidney Diseases, Male, Mutation, Phenotype, Pregnancy, Retrospective Studies",yes,no,ca,yes,CA,28881510.0, Clinical phenotypes of hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 homeobox b-associated disease ,yes,yes,yes,ea,,False

We measured their blood pressure (BP) and investigated associated factors. Hypertension was defined as an average systolic BP > or =140 mm Hg, and/or an average diastolic BP > or =90 mm Hg, and/or self-report of current treatment for hypertension with antihypertensive medication.The overall prevalence of hypertension in this study was 38.6%. Among those with hypertension, 32.8% were aware that they had high BP, 27.4% were being treated with antihypertensive medications, and in 1.4% of the women the hypertension was controlled. Multivariate analysis revealed that higher age, Mongolian ethnicity, higher body mass index (BMI), higher waist circumference (WC), excessive salt intake, smoking, alcohol consumption, lipid disorder, diabetes, and family history of hypertension were associated with the prevalence of hypertension; a higher level of education (high school or beyond) and a higher income level were inversely related to hypertension prevalence.Our results indicate that hypertension is highly prevalent in rural women in Liaoning province and it is associated with known risk factors. There are unacceptably low percentages of those with hypertension who are aware of their condition, are receiving treatment, and in whom hypertension is controlled. Our study suggests the urgent need for a public health program to improve the prevention, detection, and treatment of hypertension in rural Chinese women.","Adult, Aged, Antihypertensive Agents, Awareness, Blood Pressure, China, Cross-Sectional Studies, Disease Outbreaks, Female, Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice, Humans, Hypertension, Middle Aged, National Health Programs, Prevalence, Risk Factors, Rural Health, Women's Health",no,no,ca,yes,CA,18443569.0, The accelerating epidemic of hypertension among rural Chinese women: results from Liaoning Province ,no,no,yes,ea,,False

We evaluated data from 1124 patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) of Caucasian, Mongoloid, Asian, Armenian, Northern African and Negroid origin who were referred between January 1993 and December 1994. Logistic regression analyses showed that the occurrence of microvascular complications was significantly associated with duration of NIDDM. In addition, retinopathy was significantly associated with glycated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and nephropathy with triglycerides (P < 0.05 and P < < 0.001 respectively). Northern African origin was associated with retinopathy (P < 0.05) and Asian origin with nephropathy (P < 0.005). Macrovascular complication was associated with age and triglyceride level (P < 0.001 and P < 0.05 respectively). Northern African and Negroid ethnicity exclusively did not show a gradual increase in the risk for angina pectoris with increasing age. Moreover, a negative association between Northern African as well as Negroid ethnicity and macrovascular complication was observed (P = 0.05 and P < 0.05 respectively).

Results: The age-standardized prevalence of dyslipidemia was 31.2% overall, with 4.3, 2.4, 14.7, and 17.4% for high total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglycerides (TG), and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), respectively. The dyslipidemia prevalence was significantly higher in men than women (37.9% vs. 27.5%, P < 0.001), but postmenopausal women had a higher prevalence of dyslipidemia components (except low HDL-C). Compared with Han participants, Mongol participants had a lower prevalence of dyslipidemia (29.1% vs. 31.4%, P < 0.001). Male sex, living in urban areas, Han ethnicity, smoking, obesity, central obesity, hypertension, and diabetes were all positively correlated with dyslipidemia; alcohol consumption was linked to lower risk of dyslipidemia._x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_

28379037,Traditional risk factors of acute coronary syndrome in four different male populations - total cholesterol value does not seem to be relevant risk factor,"Cardiovascular diseases are the most common cause of mortality and morbidity in most populations. As the traditional modifiable risk factors (smoking, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and obesity) were defined decades ago, we decided to analyze recent data in patients who survived acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The Czech part of the study included data from 999 males, and compared them with the post-MONICA study (1,259 males, representing general population). The Lithuanian study included 479 male patients and 456 age-matched controls. The Kazakhstan part included 232 patients and 413 controls. In two countries, the most robust ACS risk factor was smoking (OR 3.85 in the Czech study and 5.76 in the Lithuanian study), followed by diabetes (OR 2.26 and 2.07) and hypertension (moderate risk elevation with OR 1.43 and 1.49). These factors did not influence the ACS risk in Kazakhstan. BMI had no significant effect on ACS and plasma cholesterol was surprisingly significantly lower (P<0.001) in patients than in controls in all countries (4.80+/-1.11 vs. 5.76+/-1.06 mmol/l in Czechs; 5.32+/-1.32 vs. 5.71+/-1.08 mmol/l in Lithuanians; 4.88+/-1.05 vs. 5.38+/-1.13 mmol/l in Kazakhs/Russians). Results from our study indicate substantial heterogeneity regarding major CVD risk factors in different populations with the exception of plasma total cholesterol which was inversely associated with ACS risk in all involved groups.

31105750,Population Levels Assessment of the Distribution of Disease-Associated Variants With Emphasis on Armenians - A Machine Learning Approach,"Background: During the last decades a number of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) has identified numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with different complex diseases. However, associations reported in one population are often conflicting and did not replicate when studied in other populations. One of the reasons could be that most GWAS employ a case-control design in one or a limited number of populations, but little attention was paid to the global distribution of disease-associated alleles across different populations. Moreover, the majority of GWAS have been performed on selected European, African, and Chinese populations and the considerable number of populations remains understudied. Aim: We have investigated the global distribution of so far discovered disease-associated SNPs across worldwide populations of different ancestry and geographical regions with a special focus on the understudied population of Armenians. Data and Methods: We have used genotyping data from the Human Genome Diversity Project and of Armenian population and combined them with disease-associated SNP data taken from public repositories leading to a final dataset of 44,234 markers. Their frequency distribution across 1039 individuals from 53 populations was analyzed using self-organizing maps (SOM) machine learning. Our SOM portrayal approach reduces data dimensionality, clusters SNPs with similar frequency profiles and provides two-dimensional data images which enable visual evaluation of disease-associated SNPs landscapes among human populations.

28420663,"Optimal body fat percentage cut-off values for identifying cardiovascular risk factors in Mongolian and Han adults: a population-based cross-sectional study in Inner Mongolia, China","The present study was designed to determine the optimal cut-off values of body fat percentage (BF%) for the detection of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors in Mongolian and Han adults.This cross-sectional study involving 3221 Chinese adults (2308 Han and 913 Mongolian) aged 20-80 years was conducted in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, China, in 2014. Data from a standardised questionnaire, physical examination and blood sample were obtained. The BF% was estimated using bioelectrical impedance analysis. Optimal BF% cut-offs were analysed by receiver operating characteristic curves to predict the risk of diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidaemia. Binary logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the OR of each CVD risk factor according to obesity defined by BF%.Mean BF% levels were lower in men than in women (22.54Â±5.77 vs 32.95Â±6.18 in Han, 23.86Â±5.72 vs 33.98Â±6.40 in Mongolian population, respectively; p<0.001). In Han population, the area under curve (AUC) values for BF% ranged from 0.589 to 0.699 for men and from 0.711 to 0.763 for women. Compared with men, AUCs for diabetes and clustering of â‰¥2â€‰risk factors in women were significantly higher (p<0.05). The AUCs for BF% in women (0.685-0.783) were similar with those in men (0.686-0.736) for CVD risk factors in Mongolian population. In Han adults, the optimal BF% cut-off values to detect CVD risk factors varied from 18.7% to 24.2% in men and 32.7% to 35.4% in women. In Mongolian population, the optimal cut-off values of BF% for men and women ranged from 21.0% to 24.6%â€‰and from 35.7% to 40.0%, respectively. Subjects with high BF% (â‰¥24% in men, â‰¥34% in women) had higher risk of CVD risk factors in Han (age-adjusted ORs from 1.479 to 3.680, 2.660 to 4.016, respectively). In Mongolia, adults with high BF% (â‰¥25% in men, â‰¥35% in women) had higher risk of CVD risk factors (age-adjusted ORs from 2.587 to 3.772, 2.061 to 4.882, respectively).The optimal BF% cut-offs for obesity for the prediction of CVD risk factors in Chinese men and women were approximately 24% and 34% for Han adults and 25% and 35% for Mongolian population of Inner Mongolia, China, respectively.Â© Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2017.

Results: 21,152 eligible participants were included in the survey. The prevalence in males and females was 2.52 % and 3.66 %, the standardized prevalence was 1.84% and 4.31% respectively, and the prevalence in females was higher than that in males (p<0.01). The prevalence in females obviously increased (p<0.01) with increasing age. More female participants with PAD were over 69 years old compared with those without PAD (18.8% vs. 10.0%, p=0.000) and more frequently have a smoking habit (11.1% vs. 2.5%, p=0.000), lipid disorders (34.8% vs. 29.2%, p=0.047), diabetes mellitus (14.8% vs. 8.6%, p=0.000), coronary heart disease (16.9% vs. 10.0%, p=0.000) and a history of stroke (6.8% vs. 2.3%, p=0.000).

30839013,Effects of n-3 fatty acid supplements on cardiometabolic profiles in hypertensive patients with abdominal obesity in Inner Mongolia: a randomized controlled trial,"Daily supplementation with n-3 fatty acid (FA) has been believed to be an adjunct or alternative to drug treatments to reduce blood pressure (BP) and triglyceride (TG) levels in western patients with high risk of cardiovascular disease. The BP-lowering effect of n-3 FA supplements among Chinese hypertensive patients has been reported in our previous 12-week, double-blind, randomized controlled trial (RCT), but the benefits on cardiometabolic profiles among obese Chinese populations are not well known. We therefore used the data from the previous RCT to investigate the effects of marine- and plant-derived n-3 FA supplements on cardiometabolic profiles in middle-aged and elderly Chinese hypertensive patients with abdominal obesity. In total, 108 eligible volunteers from Inner Mongolia, China were randomly assigned to three treatments for 12 weeks: fish oil (FO, n = 35, 2 g day-1 eicosapentaenoic acid + docosahexaenoic acid), flaxseed oil (FLO, n = 39, 2.5 g day-1 Î±-linolenic acid), and corn oil served as a control (CO, n = 34). BP, blood lipids, waist circumference (WC) and fasting glucose-insulin were measured at baseline and after 12-week intervention by using standard methods. Clustered cardiometabolic risk was expressed as a continuously distributed z-score calculated by standardizing and then summing WC, insulin, glucose, TG, HDL-cholesterol and BP values. The cardiometabolic risk scores were significantly lower in the FO group than in the CO group after the 12-week intervention (-0.41 Â± 0.92 vs. 0.02 Â± 0.95, p = 0.016), but not in the FLO group (-0.23 Â± 1.02 vs. 0.02 Â± 0.95, p = 0.109). For individual risk factors, compared with CO, FO significantly decreased LDL-cholesterol (-0.25 Â± 0.78 mmol L-1vs. -0.05 Â± 0.65 mmol L-1, p = 0.010), ApoB (-012 Â± 0.28 mmol L-1vs. -0.03 Â± 0.23 mmol L-1, p = 0.036), and WC (-1.58 Â± 3.67 cm vs. -0.52 Â± 3.27 cm, p = 0.031), whereas no significant difference was found between FLO and CO groups in LDL-cholesterol (p = 0.081), ApoB (p = 0.102) and WC (p = 0.093).

We used a mathematical model to estimate the cost-effectiveness of several health check strategies in six European countries.We used country-specific data from Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, and the United Kingdom to generate simulated populations of individuals aged 40-75 eligible for health checks in those countries (e.g. individuals without a previous diagnosis of diabetes, myocardial infarction, stroke, or serious chronic kidney disease). For each country, we used the Archimedes model to compare seven health check strategies consisting of assessments for diabetes, hypertension, lipids, and smoking. For patients diagnosed with vascular disease, treatment was simulated in a standard manner. We calculated the effects of each strategy on the incidence of type 2 diabetes, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), and microvascular complications in addition to quality of life, costs, and cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY).Compared with current care, health checks reduced the incidence of MACE (6-17 events prevented per 1000 people screened) and diabetes related microvasular complications (5-11 events prevented per 1000 people screened), and increased QALYs (31-59 discounted QALYs) over 30 years, in all countries. The cost per QALY of offering a health check to all individuals in the study cohort ranged from â‚¬14903 (France) to cost saving (Poland).

31752689,Harnessing technology and molecular analysis to understand the development of cardiovascular diseases in Asia: a prospective cohort study (SingHEART),"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) imposes much mortality and morbidity worldwide. The use of ""deep learning"", advancements in genomics, metabolomics, proteomics and devices like wearables have the potential to unearth new insights in the field of cardiology. Currently, in Asia, there are no studies that combine the use of conventional clinical information with these advanced technologies. We aim to harness these new technologies to understand the development of cardiovascular disease in Asia.Singapore is a multi-ethnic country in Asia with well-represented diverse ethnicities including Chinese, Malays and Indians. The SingHEART study is the first technology driven multi-ethnic prospective population-based study of healthy Asians. Healthy male and female subjects aged 21-69â€‰years old without any prior cardiovascular disease or diabetes mellitus will be recruited from the general population. All subjects are consented to undergo a detailed on-line questionnaire, basic blood investigations, resting and continuous electrocardiogram and blood pressure monitoring, activity and sleep tracking, calcium score, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, whole genome sequencing and lipidomic analysis. Outcomes studied will include mortality and cause of mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, malignancy, heart failure, and the development of co-morbidities.An initial target of 2500 patients has been set. From October 2015 to May 2017, an initial 683 subjects have been recruited and have completed the initial work-up the SingHEART project is the first contemporary population-based study in Asia that will include whole genome sequencing and deep phenotyping: including advanced imaging and wearable data, to better understand the development of cardiovascular disease across different ethnic groups in Asia.","Adult, Aged, Asian People, Cardiovascular Diseases, Female, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, Genome-Wide Association Study, Health Status, High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Phenotype, Predictive Value of Tests, Prospective Studies, Risk Assessment, Risk Factors, Singapore, Whole Genome Sequencing, Young Adult, Adult, Aged, Asian People, Cardiovascular Diseases, Female, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, Genome-Wide Association Study, Health Status, High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Phenotype, Predictive Value of Tests, Prospective Studies, Risk Assessment, Risk Factors, Singapore, Whole Genome Sequencing, Young Adult",no,no,ea,yes,SSA,31752689.0, Harnessing technology and molecular analysis to understand the development of cardiovascular diseases in Asia: a prospective cohort study (SingHEART) ,yes,no,yes,seap,,False
10963181,Glucose metabolic analysis of musculoskeletal tumours using 18fluorine-FDG PET as an aid to preoperative planning,"We performed positron emission tomography (PET) with 18 fluorine-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) on 55 patients with tumours involving the musculoskeletal system in order to evaluate its role in operative planning. The standardised uptake value (SUV) of FDG was calculated and, to distinguish malignancies from benign lesions, the cases were divided into high (> or =1.9) and low (< 1.9) SUV groups. The sensitivity of PET for correctly diagnosing malignancy was 100% with a specificity of 76.9% and an overall accuracy of 83.0%. The mean SUV for metastatic lesions was twice that for primary sarcomas (p < 0.0015). Our results suggest that the SUV may be useful in differentiating malignant tumours from benign lesions. However, some of the latter, such as schwannomas, had high SUVs so that biopsy or wide resection was selected as the first operation. Thus, some other quantitative analysis may be required for preoperative planning in cases of high-SUV neurogenic benign tumours. The reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction revealed that the RNA message of a key enzyme in glucose metabolism, phosphohexose isomerase (PHI)/autocrine motility factor, was augmented in only high FDG-uptake lesions, suggesting that a high expression of the PHI message may be associated with accumulation of FDG in musculoskeletal tumours.","Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Bone Neoplasms, Child, Female, Fluorodeoxyglucose F18, Glucose-6-Phosphate Isomerase, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Musculoskeletal Diseases, Radionuclide Imaging, Radiopharmaceuticals, Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction, Sarcoma, Sensitivity and Specificity, Soft Tissue Neoplasms",no,no,ea,yes,SSA,10963181.0, Glucose metabolic analysis of musculoskeletal tumours using 18fluorine-FDG PET as an aid to preoperative planning ,no,no,yes,not specified,,False
32076124,A case of malignant hyperlactaemic acidosis appearing upon treatment with the mono-carboxylase transporter 1 inhibitor AZD3965,"A 47-year-old man with metastatic melanoma presented with refractory hyperlactaemic acidosis following the first dose of the mono-carboxylase transporter 1 inhibitor AZD3965 within a ""first time in man"" clinical trial. The mechanism of the agent and the temporal relationship suggested that this event was potentially drug related and recruitment was suspended. However, urinary metabolomics showed extensive abnormalities even prior to drug administration, leading to investigations for an underlying metabolic disorder. The lack of clinical symptoms from the elevated lactate and low blood glucose suggested a diagnosis of ""hyper-Warburgism"", where the high tumour burden was associated with extensive glucose uptake and lactate efflux from malignant cells, and the subsequent impact on blood biochemistry. This was supported by an FDG-PET scan showing extensive glucose uptake in numerous metastases and lack of uptake in the brain. A review of the literature showed 16 case reports of ""hyper-Warburgism"" in non-haematological malignancies, none of them with melanoma, with most associated with a poor outcome. The patient was treated symptomatically, but died 2 months later.

30166214,miR-718 is involved in malignancy of papillary thyroid cancer through repression of PDPK1,"MicroRNAs bind the 3' untranslated regions (3'-UTRs) of mRNAs and thereby regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally and play an important role in cancer delvelopment. In the present study, we have explored the role of miR-718 in papillary thyroid cancer cell malignancy.Here we examined the miRNA expression in human papillary thyroid cancer by RT-PCR. Luciferase activity, RT-PCR and western blot assays were used to confirmed the target of miRNA. MTT, colony formation, transwell, glucose consumption and lactate production assays were performed to analyze papillary thyroid cancer cell function. Western blot for signaling proteins was used to reveal the mechanism.We first determined that miR-718 mRNA expression levels in PTC samples were reduced. The 3'-UTR of 3-Phosphoinositide Dependent Protein Kinase 1 (PDPK1) was then identified as a target of miR-718. Luciferase assays showed that miR-718 does in fact bind the wild-type PDPK1 3'-UTR. We assessed the effects of miR-718 on p-Akt, Akt, p-mTOR and mTOR expression. We determined that miR-718 negatively regulates their levels, respectively, of Akt-mTOR pathway components. We then assessed the effects of miR-718 on PTC cell behavior. The results revealed that miR-718 negatively regulates PTC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. In addition, miR-718 was found to inhibit cell glucose metabolism, likely through the Akt-mTOR pathway. Finally, PDPK1 could rescue PTC cell inhibition induced by miR-718.The present study strongly suggests that miR-718 inhibits PTC cell proliferation, metastasis, and glucose metabolism by negatively regulating the Akt-mTOR signaling pathway.Copyright Â© 2018.

22486993,Adrenal neoplasms,"Adenoma, myelolipoma, phaeochromocytoma, metastases, adrenocortical carcinoma, neuroblastoma, and lymphoma account for the majority of adrenal neoplasms that are encountered in clinical practice. A variety of imaging methods are available for evaluating adrenal lesions including ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and nuclear medicine techniques such as meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy and positron-emission tomography (PET). Lipid-sensitive imaging techniques such as unenhanced CT and chemical shift MRI enable detection and characterization of lipid-rich adenomas based on an unenhanced CT attenuation of â‰¤ 10 HU and signal loss on opposed-phase compared to in-phase T1-weighted images, respectively. In indeterminate cases, an adrenal CT washout study may differentiate adenomas (both lipid-rich and lipid-poor) from other adrenal neoplasms based on an absolute percentage washout of >60% and/or a relative percentage washout of >40%. This is based on the principle that adenomas show rapid contrast washout while most other adrenal neoplasms including malignant tumours show slow contrast washout instead. Â¹â¸F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose-PET (Â¹â¸FDG-PET) imaging may differentiate benign from malignant adrenal neoplasms by demonstrating high tracer uptake in malignant neoplasms based on the increased glucose utilization and metabolic activity found in most of these malignancies. In this review, the multi-modality imaging appearances of adrenal neoplasms are discussed and illustrated. Key imaging findings that facilitate lesion characterization and differentiation are emphasized. Awareness of these imaging findings is essential for improving diagnostic confidence and for reducing misinterpretation errors.Copyright Â© 2012 The Royal College of Radiologists.

A review and hypothesis","Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the novel virus SARS-CoV-2, is often more severe in older adults. Besides age, other underlying conditions such as obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, and malignancies, which are also associated with aging, have been considered risk factors for COVID-19 mortality. A rapidly expanding body of evidence has brought up various scenarios for these observations and hyperinflammatory reactions associated with COVID-19 pathogenesis. Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) generated upon glycation of proteins, DNA, or lipids play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of age-related diseases and all of the above-mentioned COVID-19 risk factors. Interestingly, the receptor for AGEs (RAGE) is mainly expressed by type 2 epithelial cells in the alveolar sac, which has a critical role in SARS-CoV-2-associated hyper inflammation and lung injury.

The quality of mango fruit and its biological activities may change depending upon the variation in geographical factors. For the first time, this study comprehensively screened the biological activities of all four parts of the mango fruit from twelve different origins. Various cell lines (MCF7, HCT116, HepG2, MRC5) were used to screen the extracts for their cytotoxicity, glucose uptake, glutathione peroxidase activity, and Î±-amylase inhibition. MTT assays were carried out to calculate the IC50 values for the most effective extracts. The seed part from Kenya and Sri Lanka origins exhibited an IC50 value of 14.44 Â± 3.61 (HCT116) and 17.19 Â± 1.60 (MCF7). The seed part for Yemen Badami (119 Â± 0.08) and epicarp part of Thailand (119 Â± 0.11) mango fruit showed a significant increase in glucose utilization (50 Î¼g/mL) as compared to the standard drug metformin (123 Â± 0.07).

It codes a DNA-helicase, whose defects cause genomic instability. The highest incidences are reported in Japan and Sardinia (Italy). On this major island of the Mediterranean Basin, the WS cases have been observed in the northern areas. The authors describe the apparently first case reported in southern Sardinia, a 51-year-old woman, who was born in and resides in the province of Cagliari. She presented with a 9-year history of an intractable leg ulcer and other characteristic symptoms, including ""bird-like"" face, high-pitched voice, premature greying, short stature, abdominal obesity in contrast with thin body type, scleroderma-like legs, decreased muscle mass, diabetes, atherosclerosis, and premature menopause. A specialized genetic Institute of Research (IRCCS-IDI, Rome) confirmed the clinical diagnosis. There is no cure or specific treatment and patients must be periodically screened for an increased risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease and malignancies. Among the many findings, leg ulcers significantly affect the patient's quality of life. This problem may send the patient to the dermatologist, who finally suspects the diagnosis.

8707285,Variable gene expression within human tyrosinemia type 1 liver may reflect region-specific dysplasia,"Patients with hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 have a deficiency of fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH) and develop progressive hepatocellular dysfunction with a high risk of malignant transformation. Serum alpha-fetoprotein levels are frequently elevated in these patients; therefore, this commonly used marker of tumorigenesis is inadequate. To date, no literature exists describing the hepatic gene alterations in patients with this disease. We analyzed the expression of a panel of proliferation associated and liver-specific genes in the liver of a 33 month-old girl at the time of orthotopic liver transplantation. This study provides information that may be useful in developing markers for malignancy and understanding the pathogenesis of this disease. Gene expression patterns of two regenerating nodules and total liver from the patient with FAH deficiency were compared with control donor liver. Liver-specific and growth-induced genes with altered expression in the tyrosinemic liver included several functional classes: structural proteins (actin, thrombospondin), transcription factors (c-fos, egr-1, C/EBPalpha), liver-specific enzymes (glucose-6-phosphatase [G6Phase], and secreted factors (insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1 [GFBP-1]. Isolated macronodules demonstrated varied patterns of expression, suggesting that they do not form a homogeneous cellular environment. In the tyrosinemic liver, IGFBP-1 messenger RNA expression was high and G6Phase messenger RNA was not detectable. Although G6Phase and IGFBP-1 are coexpressed in regenerating liver, immunohistochemistry in the tyrosinemic liver demonstrated a mutually exclusive distribution for the two proteins in a tissue section with features of dysplasia. We propose that cells in these areas may have an aberrant transcription factor and growth factor ""milieu"" that leads to altered gene and protein expression. These molecular alterations are reflected in dysplastic histologic changes and may ultimately predispose to the development of malignancy._x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_

33330620,Renal Carcinoma Is Associated With Increased Risk of Coronavirus Infections,"Background: The current COVID-19 pandemic has affected most severely people with old age, or with comorbidities like hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and cancer. Cancer patients are twice more likely to contract the disease because of the malignancy or treatment-related immunosuppression; hence identification of the vulnerable population among these patients is essential. Method: We took a bioinformatics approach to analyze the gene and protein expression data of these coronavirus receptors (DPP4, ANPEP, ENPEP, TMPRSS2) in human normal and cancer tissues of multiple organs including the brain, liver, kidney, heart, lung, skin, GI tract, pancreas, endocrine tissues, and the reproductive organs. RNA-Seq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and GTeX databases were used for extensive profiling analysis of these receptors across 9,736 tumors and 8,587 normal tissues comparing coronavirus receptors. Protein expression from immunohistochemistry data was assessed from The Human Protein Atlas database including 144 samples, corresponding to 48 different normal human tissue types, and 432 tumor samples from 216 different cancer patients. The correlations between immune cell infiltration, chemokine, and cytokines were investigated via Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER) and TCGA. Result: We found that among all, renal tumor and normal tissues exhibited increased levels of ACE2, DPP4, ANPEP, and ENPEP. Our results revealed that TMPRSS2 may not be the co-receptor for coronavirus infection in renal carcinoma patients. The other receptors DPP4, ANPEP, and ENPEP may act as the compensatory receptor proteins to help ACE2. The receptors' expression levels were variable in different tumor stage, molecular, and immune subtypes of renal carcinoma. Intriguingly, in clear cell renal cell carcinomas, coronavirus receptors were associated with high immune infiltration, markers of immunosuppression, and T cell exhaustion. Conclusion: Our study indicates that CoV receptors may play an important role in modulating the immune infiltrate and hence cellular immunity in renal carcinoma. As our current knowledge of pathogenic mechanisms will improve, it may help us in designing focused therapeutic approaches.Copyright Â© 2020 Tripathi, Deshmukh, Creighton and Patil.",,no,no,sa,yes,SSA,33330620.0, Renal Carcinoma Is Associated With Increased Risk of Coronavirus Infections ,no,no,no,Unknown,,False

Renal transplantation recipients were randomized to Group 1 (SRL+TAC; week 13 TAC elimination [n = 152]), Group 2 (SRL + MMF [n = 152]) or Group 3 (TAC + MMF [n = 139]). Group 2, with higher-than-expected biopsy-confirmed acute rejections (BCARs), was sponsor-terminated; therefore, Group 2 two-year data were limited.

7012876,Prostaglandins and the alpha-cell,"Experimental evidence has recently accumulated indicating that administration of some prostaglandins (PGs), particularly those of the E series, can evoke release of glucagon by the pancreatic alpha-cells. Virtually, all the in vitro studies (isolated perfused rat pancreas, isolated guinea-pig islets) agree that PGs can increase both basal and stimulated glucagon release. On the other hand, inhibition of PG synthesis with indomethacin blocks glucagon release. In rats and in normal humans, PGE1, but not PGA2 or PGF2a, causes a progressive rise of plasma glucagon levels. While in the rat this response seems independent of the adrenergic nervous system, in man the hyperglucagonemia induced by PGE1 is easily suppressed by propranolol, suggesting an interaction between the prostaglandin and the beta-receptors of the alpha-cell. Studies with inhibitors of PG synthesis in vivo have yielded conflicting results, depending on the particular experimental protocol used and on the type of inhibitor tested. In normal humans, it seems that acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) has no effect on glucagon response to arginine, tolbutamide and insulin-induced hypoglycemia. Conversely, a stimulator of PG synthesis, such as furosemide, increases glucagon response to an arginine pulse in man. In insulin-dependent diabetics, who present an exaggerated glucagon response to stimulants, ASA fails to alter glucagon response to arginine, but completely blunts the glucagon response to salbutamol, a weak beta-2 receptor agonist. In conclusion, these observations provide evidence in support to a role for PGs, at least PGE, in the contro of glucagon release.","Albuterol, Animals, Arginine, Aspirin, Blood Glucose, Diabetes Mellitus, Furosemide, Glucagon, Guinea Pigs, Humans, Indomethacin, Islets of Langerhans, Kinetics, Propranolol, Prostaglandins, Prostaglandins E, Rats",no,no,Unknown,yes,SSA,7012876.0, Prostaglandins and the alpha-cell ,no,yes,yes,we,,False
24944883,Tumor suppressive miRNA-34a suppresses cell proliferation and tumor growth of glioma stem cells by targeting Akt and Wnt signaling pathways,"MiRNA-34a is considered as a potential prognostic marker for glioma, as studies suggest that its expression negatively correlates with patient survival in grade III and IV glial tumors. Here, we show that expression of miR-34a was decreased in a graded manner in glioma and glioma stem cell-lines as compared to normal brain tissues. Ectopic expression of miR-34a in glioma stem cell-lines HNGC-2 and NSG-K16 decreased the proliferative and migratory potential of these cells, induced cell cycle arrest and caused apoptosis. Notably, the miR-34a glioma cells formed significantly smaller xenografts in immuno-deficient mice as compared with control glioma stem cell-lines. Here, using a bioinformatics approach and various biological assays, we identify Rictor, as a novel target for miR-34a in glioma stem cells. Rictor, a defining component of mTORC2 complex, is involved in cell survival signaling. mTORC2 lays downstream of Akt, and thus is a direct activator of Akt. Our earlier studies have elaborated on role of Rictor in glioma invasion (Das et al., 2011). Here, we demonstrate that miR34a over-expression in glioma stem cells profoundly decreased levels of p-AKT (Ser473), increased GSK-3Î² levels and targeted for degradation Î²-catenin, an important mediator of Wnt signaling pathway. This led to diminished levels of the Wnt effectors cyclin D1 and c-myc. Collectively, we show that the tumor suppressive function of miR-34a in glioblastoma is mediated via Rictor, which through its effects on AKT/mTOR pathway and Wnt signaling causes pronounced effects on glioma malignancy.",,no,no,sa,yes,SSA,24944883.0, Tumor suppressive miRNA-34a suppresses cell proliferation and tumor growth of glioma stem cells by targeting Akt and Wnt signaling pathways ,no,no,yes,Unknown,,False

33510184,An evaluation of lipid profile and pro-inflammatory cytokines as determinants of cardiovascular disease in those with diabetes: a study on a Mexican American cohort,"Sedentary life styles coupled with high-calorie diets and unhealthy social habits such as smoking, have put an ever-increasing number of people at risk of cardiovascular disorders (CVD), worldwide. A concomitant increase in the prevalence of type 2-diabetes (hyperglycemia), a risk factor for CVD, has further contributed towards escalating CVD-related mortalities. The increase in number of cases of type 2-diabetes underscores the importance of early diagnosis of cardiovascular disease in those with diabetes. In this work, we have evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of dyslipidemia and proinflammatory cytokines to be used as biomarkers for predicting the risk of CVD in those with diabetes. We hypothesize that interplay between dyslipidemia and diabetes-induced low-grade inflammation in those with type 2-diabetes increases the risk of CVD. A total of 215 participants were randomly recruited from the Cameron County Hispanic Cohort (CCHC). Of these, 99% were Mexican Americans living on Texas-Mexico border. Levels of cytokines, adipokines and lipid profile were measured. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) for this study was defined as prior diagnosis of heart attack, angina and stroke, while diabetes was defined by fasting blood glucose (FBG) ofâ€‰>â€‰100Â mg/dL and HbA1c ofâ€‰>â€‰6.5, in accordance with American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines. Depending on type and distribution of data, various statistical tests were performed. Our results demonstrated higher rates of heart attack (14% vs 11.8%) and stroke (19.8% vs 10%) in those with diabetes as compared to non-diabetes. The odds of having a heart attack were eight times higher in the presence of elevated triglycerides and pro-inflammatory markers (TNFÎ± and IL6) as compared to presence of pro-inflammatory markers only. The odds for heart attack among those with diabetes, increased by 20 fold in presence of high levels of triglycerides, TNFÎ±, and IL6 when coupled with low levels of high-density lipid cholesterol (HDL-C). Lastly, our analysis showed that poorly controlled diabetes, characterized by HbA1c values ofâ€‰>â€‰6.5 increases the odds of stroke by more than three fold. The study quantifies the role of lipid profile and pro-inflammatory markers in combination with standard risk factors towards predicting the risk of CVD in those with type 2-diabetes. The findings from the study can be directly translated for use in early diagnosis of heart disease and guiding interventions leading to a reduction in CVD-associated mortality in those with type 2-diabetes.","Biomarkers, Cardiovascular Diseases, Cohort Studies, Cytokines, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2, Female, Humans, Lipids, Male, Mexican Americans, Middle Aged, Myocardial Infarction, Prevalence, ROC Curve, Risk, Risk Assessment, Stroke",no,yes,unk,yes,U,33510184.0, An evaluation of lipid profile and pro-inflammatory cytokines as determinants of cardiovascular disease in those with diabetes: a study on a Mexican American cohort ,no,yes,yes,lac,,False

However, research is limited on adherence to these guidelines in the pediatric population. This retrospective chart review examined 56 charts from 6 physician offices and 1 multispecialty health care system in Ohio. Variables of interest included recommendations from the 2007 ADA Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes. HgA1c was measured every 3 months in 44.6% of patients, while 55% achieved A1c goal. Blood pressure was monitored in all patients, with 57% meeting goal. Lipids and urine microalbumin were tested annually in 51.7% and 26.7% of patients, respectively. Dilated eye and foot exams were performed on 53.5% and 37.5% of patients, respectively. Adherence to ADA clinical guidelines for pediatric patients with type 2 diabetes is suboptimal.

27701714,The Therapeutic Effect of Pancreatic Kininogenase on Treatment of Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes,"Background: To determine the therapeutic efficacy and cost-effective of pancreatic kininogenase (PKase) on treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) compared with Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) in patients with type 2 diabetes. Methods: 104 patients with DPN receiving standard glucose control therapy were randomly assigned into 3 groups: Group-A received PKase treatment, Group-B received PGE1 treatment, and Group-C received only standard glucose control therapy. Michigan neuropathy screening instrument (MNSI) score, neurophysiology examination, and nerve conduction velocity were measured. Results: Standard glucose control therapy significantly reduced hyperglycemia to a similar level in all groups. Questionnaire grading and neurophysiology examination both indicated that no significant difference was found at the end of treatment between Groups -A and -B. Except for the ulnar nerve sensory conduction velocity that was significantly improved in Group-B, the remaining nerve conduction velocity (regardless of sensory or motor nerve conduction velocities) was improved to a similar level in Groups -A and -B. Group-A had significantly reduced questionnaire grading and better improvement in motor nerve conduction velocity of the common peroneal nerve, ulnar nerve, and sensory nerve conduction velocity of the sural nerve as compared with Group-C. However, the medical cost of PKase was only 18.9% of that of PGE1 during one course of treatment. Conclusions: PKase has the similar therapeutic efficacy as PGE1 on treatment of DPN in patients with type 2 diabetes. However, the medical cost of PKase is one fifth of that of PGE1. Thus, PKase is a cost-effective drug for treatment of DPN._x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_

17659063,"Serum 1,5-anhydroglucitol (Glycomark) levels in children with and without type 1 diabetes mellitus","Postprandial hyperglycemia associated with diabetes is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Currently, glycated hemoglobin A(1c) (HgbA(1c)) and glycated protein fructosamine are not sensitive markers for acute and short-term hyperglycemia. 1,5-Anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG) (Glycomark; Tomen America, New York, NY, USA) is reported in adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) as a marker for postmeal hyperglycemia. However, the reference ranges for 1,5-AG in normal children and children with T1DM are not known. We studied 1,5-AG levels in 10 control children (6 males and 4 females) and 10 children with T1DM (7 males and 3 females). The levels of 1,5-AG in the normal controls were higher than those in children with T1DM (24.60 +/- 3.99 microg/mL vs. 4.75 +/- 2.95 microg/mL; p < 0.0001). There were no gender differences noted. The 1,5-AG levels were negatively correlated with HgbA(1c) (r =-0.9366; p < 0.0001) and the peak postmeal plasma glucose concentrations (Pearson r =-7230; p = 0.0003). Our findings suggest that despite good glycemic control, postprandial glucose concentrations are elevated and that 1,5-AG showed a difference between controls and children with T1DM. The data are comparable with previous studies in normal adults and in those with T1DM and T2DM. They support the use of 1,5-AG concentrations, together with HgbA(1c), to evaluate therapy, especially to target postprandial hyperglycemia.","Adolescent, Biomarkers, Blood Glucose, Child, Deoxyglucose, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1, Female, Glycated Hemoglobin, Humans, Male, Reference Values",no,yes,unk,yes,U,17659063.0," Serum 1,5-anhydroglucitol (Glycomark) levels in children with and without type 1 diabetes mellitus ",no,yes,yes,Unknown,,False
18353616,Use of medications to reduce cardiovascular risk among individuals with psychotic disorders and Type 2 diabetes,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in patients with serious mental illness (SMI) and in patients with Type 2 diabetes. Inadequate pharmacologic care for CVD may partially explain poor health outcomes in individuals with both conditions. We sought to identify patients in this group at greatest risk for suboptimal pharmacologic management.Among individuals with Type 2 diabetes and SMI identified from Maryland Medicaid data, we evaluated patient and service utilization factors associated with the prescription of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (""statins"") for hyperlipidemia and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) for chronic kidney disease, congestive heart failure, and hypertension.From 2001 to 2003, the annual prevalence of use of statins and ACE-inhibitors/ARBs ranged from 44 to 59%, with rates increasing each year. Being female, having certain cardiovascular conditions, and having a greater number of outpatient visits for diabetes increased the odds of receiving statins and ACE-inhibitors/ARBs. More frequent contact with the mental health system was associated with a lower likelihood of receipt of both medication classes; having a substance use disorder was associated with reduced use of statins. African-Americans were less likely than Caucasians to receive statins, but more likely to receive prescriptions for ACE-inhibitors/ARBs.Although the use of cardioprotective medications in individuals with Type 2 diabetes and SMI increased over the study period, a considerable proportion of patients remained inadequately managed despite their considerable cardiac risk. Further study should focus on observed racial variations and strategies to increase the capacity of mental health contacts to improve prescribing of these agents.","Adult, Aged, Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors, Cardiovascular Diseases, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2, Drug Utilization, Female, Humans, Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors, Male, Maryland, Middle Aged, Multivariate Analysis, Psychotic Disorders, Retrospective Studies, Risk",no,yes,unk,yes,U,18353616.0, Use of medications to reduce cardiovascular risk among individuals with psychotic disorders and Type 2 diabetes ,no,yes,yes,Unknown,,False
11735847,"Clozapine use in patients with schizophrenia and the risk of diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension: a claims-based approach","Numerous case reports have linked clozapine to the development of diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia in patients with schizophrenia. However, investigators have been unable to clearly demonstrate this association when compared with a control group receiving conventional antipsychotics.Medical and pharmacy claims from the Iowa Medicaid program were used to compare incidence rates for diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension in 552 patients receiving clozapine and 2461 patients receiving conventional antipsychotics (eg, haloperidol, chlorpromazine hydrochloride), with the use of a retrospective cohort design. Logistic regression was used to compare incidence rates adjusting for age, sex, and duration of available follow-up.No significant differences in overall incidence rates for diabetes, hyperlipidemia, or hypertension were observed in patients receiving clozapine vs conventional antipsychotics. However, among younger patients (aged 20-34 years), clozapine administration was associated with a significantly increased relative risk of diabetes (2.5 [95% confidence interval, 1.2-5.4]) and hyperlipidemia (2.4 [95% confidence interval, 1.1-5.2]), but not hypertension (0.9 [95% confidence interval, 0.4-2.0]).These data suggest that clozapine may not be an independent cause of diabetes or hyperlipidemia, but instead acts as an effect modifier in susceptible populations by increasing weight or affecting insulin secretion and resistance. This finding requires confirmation in other settings and patient populations and with the other atypical antipsychotics (risperidone, olanzapine, and quetiapine fumarate). The potential long-term medical and economic implications of the early induction of diabetes and hyperlipidemia in patients with schizophrenia warrant further study.","Adult, Age Factors, Antipsychotic Agents, Causality, Clozapine, Cohort Studies, Confidence Intervals, Cross-Sectional Studies, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Hyperlipidemias, Hypertension, Incidence, Iowa, Male, Middle Aged, Product Surveillance, Postmarketing, Retrospective Studies, Risk, Schizophrenia",no,yes,unk,yes,U,11735847.0, Clozapine use in patients with schizophrenia and the risk of diabetes ,no,yes,yes,Unknown,,False

Subjects were recruited in 1989-1990 in Forsyth County, North Carolina; Sacramento County, California; Washington County, Maryland; and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In multivariate linear regression models, cardiac risk factors significantly associated with fibrinogen were current smoking, race, lipids, and white blood count. In women, alcohol use, obesity, physical activity, and insulin level were also significant, while in men hypertension was correlated. The significant correlates of factor VII were lipids and white blood count in men and estrogen use, alcohol use, race, lipids, insulin level, white blood count, and obesity in women. The independent correlates of factor VIII were insulin, glucose, and race in both sexes; low density lipoprotein cholesterol, white blood count, and diuretic use in men; and alcohol use in women. In multivariate models, factors known to be modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease accounted for more of the population variance of these hemostatic factors in women than in men, especially for factor VII. The hemostatic factors may mediate some effects of risk factors on disease, and this should be considered in longitudinal studies.","Age Distribution, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Analysis of Variance, Cardiovascular Diseases, Cohort Studies, Factor VII, Factor VIII, Female, Fibrinogen, Humans, Linear Models, Logistic Models, Male, Prevalence, Risk Factors, Sex Distribution, United States",no,no,unk,yes,U,8651228.0, Association of fibrinogen and coagulation factors VII and VIII with cardiovascular risk factors in the elderly: the Cardiovascular Health Study.

24991923,The Utah Remote Monitoring Project: improving health care one patient at a time,"The expanding role of technology to augment diabetes care and management highlights the need for clinicians to learn about these new tools. As these tools continue to evolve and enhance improved outcomes, it is imperative that clinicians consider the role of telemonitoring, or remote monitoring, in patient care. This article describes a successful telemonitoring project in Utah.This was a nonrandomized prospective observational preintervention-postintervention study, using a convenience sample. Patients with uncontrolled diabetes and/or hypertension from four rural and two urban primary care clinics and one urban stroke center participated in a telemonitoring program. The primary clinical outcome measures were changes in hemoglobin A1C (A1C) and blood pressure. Other outcomes included fasting lipids, weight, patient engagement, diabetes knowledge, hypertension knowledge, medication adherence, and patient perceptions of the usefulness of the telemonitoring program.Mean A1C decreased from 9.73% at baseline to 7.81% at the end of the program (P<0.0001). Systolic blood pressure also declined significantly, from 130.7 mm Hg at baseline to 122.9 mm Hg at the end (P=0.0001). Low-density lipoprotein content decreased significantly, from 103.9 mg/dL at baseline to 93.7 mg/dL at the end (P=0.0263). Other clinical parameters improved nonsignificantly. Knowledge of diabetes and hypertension increased significantly (P<0.001 for both). Patient engagement and medication adherence also improved, but not significantly.

This analysis, based on a cross-sectional study, explores the possible associations of saturated FA content in red blood cells (RBCs) and parameters of glucose metabolism in a sample of Alaska Natives.The sample included 343 women and 282 men aged 35-74. Statistical analyses explored the associations of selected RBC (myristic, palmitic and stearic acids) FAs with fasting glucose (plasma), fasting insulin (plasma), 2h glucose (2-hour glucose tolerance test), 2h insulin and homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) index. The models included sex and glucose metabolism status as fixed factors and age, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, physical activity (METS) and FA content in RBCs as covariates. Measures of insulin, glucose and HOMA index were used as dependent variables.Myristic acid was positively associated with fasting insulin (Î²=0.47, p<0.001), 2h insulin (Î²=0.53, p=0.02) and HOMA index (Î²=0.455, p<0.001).

22084892,Physician-specific variation in medication adherence among diabetes patients,"To examine the relationship that the patient has with his/her healthcare practitioner as a factor affecting medication adherence.Aggregate, physician-level adherence rates for patients were compared in a retrospective, non-case-controlled study of 3777 diabetes patients enrolled in a commercial pharmacy benefits program in a 6-county area in northeast Ohio.Data for the top prescribing 200 physicians and their 3777 patients were analyzed based on the adherence of their patients to medications for diabetes, statins, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (ACEIs/ARBs). Physicians were then separated into adherence quartiles based on the results. Statistical tests for assessing between-group differences were performed. Results were reported for diabetes medication-specific adherence as well as adherence to statins and ACEIs/ARBs.No appreciable demographic differences were noted between patient or physician groups, including age, sex, race, cost share, and chronic medication use. Statistically significant differences in aggregate physician-specific medication adherence between the best performing and worst performing physician quartiles were identified, with medication adherence rates of 89.5% for the highest performing quartile compared with 68.1% for the lowest performing quartile. Medication adherence for statins and ACEIs/ARBs paralleled the results for diabetes medications: 88.4% versus 73.4% and 89.8% versus 76.9%, respectively. Importantly, significantly fewer patients in the lowest performing physician group had filled prescriptions for statins or ACEIs/ARBs.Physician-specific factors have an underappreciated impact on medication adherence.

12864873,A basis for accelerated progression of diabetic nephropathy in Pima Indians,"The Pima Indians of Arizona not only have a much higher incidence of nephropathy due to type 2 diabetes than Caucasians, but they also lose their renal function at an accelerated rate after they develop diabetic nephropathy. This rapid loss of renal function occurs despite a younger age of onset of nephropathy and lower blood pressures and lipid levels, all of which would seem to predict a slower rate of progression of nephropathy. These findings suggest that other factors contribute to the rapid progression of renal disease in this population. In particular, glomerulomegaly in this population may contribute to the high rate of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) loss during the terminal, clinically manifest phase of nephropathy, because of the greater incremental loss of single-nephron GFR (SNGFR) with each nephron lost to sclerosis. In nine Pima Indians with type 2 diabetic nephropathy who underwent renal biopsy followed by serial iothalamate clearances for up to ten years, we examined the relationship between glomerular tuft volume at initial biopsy and the rate of GFR loss during the terminal phase. By multivariate analysis, significant independent effects of both glomerular volume (P=0.006) and podocyte density (P=0.043) were evident in these individuals. The effect of glomerular volume may result from a greater loss of intrinsic filtration capacity with each glomerulus lost, while the effect of podocyte density may reflect the destabilizing influence of ""podocyte insufficiency"" on the glomerular tuft. Similar factors may play a role in the rapid loss of GFR associated with progressive glomerular diseases in other indigenous populations in whom glomerulomegaly and glomerulopenia coexist.","Arizona, Diabetic Nephropathies, Disease Progression, Glomerular Filtration Rate, Humans, Indians, North American",no,yes,unk,yes,U,12864873.0, A basis for accelerated progression of diabetic nephropathy in Pima Indians ,no,yes,yes,Unknown,,False

Sixty-nine persons were identified who were in good health and had normal glucose levels during glucose tolerance testing. These subjects lived within 25 miles of the Vertac/Hercules Superfund site located in Jacksonville, Arkansas. The blood sera lipid concentrations of TCDD for the 69 subjects ranged between 2 and 94 ppt. When subjects with blood sera lipid TCDD levels in the top 10% (TCDD > 15 ppt, n = 7) were compared to subjects with lower levels (2-15 ppt, n = 62), there were no group differences in age, obesity, gender distribution, total lipids, or glucose levels. However, plasma insulin concentrations, at fasting and 30, 60, and 120 min following a 75 g glucose load, were significantly higher in the group with high blood TCDD levels. These finding could not be explained by other known risk factors for hyperinsulinemia.

After the exclusion of secondary causes (diabetes, alcohol misuse, gallbladder disease, chronic kidney disease, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, estrogen, and drug use) and responses to lipid-lowering treatment, probable patients with FCS were identified. A systematic review of all published literature on the prevalence and management guidelines for FCS was then presented and discussed.Out of 7 699 288 charts queried, 138 patients with TG levels of â‰¥880 mg/dL and documented evidence of at least 1 episode of acute pancreatitis were identified. Nine patients did not have any documented secondary causes of chylomicronemia. Four of the 9 patients had >20% decrease in TG levels after lipid-lowering treatment, 2 patients were not responsive to lipid-lowering medication, and data on lipid-lowering medications were missing in 3 patients.Our study estimates the prevalence of probable FCS at a range of 0.26 to 0.66 per million.

This study provides a preliminary description of changes in coronary artery calcium following islet transplantation, and associated factors. Coronary artery calcium was measured in 14 patients with type 1 diabetes (11 had measures both pre- and post-transplant [mean 2.3Â years]) in the University of Illinois at Chicago's clinical trial. Multivariable mixed-effects linear regression of repeated measures was used to quantify calcium change and determine if this change was longitudinally associated with risk/protective factors. Thirteen of the patients were female, with mean baseline age, diabetes duration, and BMI of 47.6 and 28.7Â years, and 23.1, respectively. Over half (57%) had detectable coronary artery calcium pre-transplant. Minimal change (0.39Â mm3 /y, PÂ =Â .02) occurred in coronary artery calcium levels pre- to post-transplant. No patient met criteria for calcium progression. Coronary artery calcium was positively associated with total and small VLDL particles (PÂ â‰¤Â .02), statin dose (PÂ =Â .02), and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (PÂ =Â .04) and negatively associated with free fatty acids (PÂ =Â .03), total HDL (PÂ =Â .03), large HDL particles (PÂ =Â .005), and tacrolimus dose (PÂ =Â .02).

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the cytoprotective activity of Pueraria montana var. lobata ethanol extract (PLE) for ultraviolet B (UVB) induced oxidative stress in human dermal fibroblasts (HDF). It was hypothesized that PLE treatment (25-100 Î¼g/mL) would reduce intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels as well as increase collagen production in UVB-irradiated HDF. The results confirmed this theory, with collagen production increasing in the PLE treatment group in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, regulators of cellular ROS accumulation, including HO-1 and NOQ-1, were activated by Nrf2, which was mediated by PLE. Hence, intracellular levels of ROS were also reduced in the PLE treatment group in a dose-dependent manner. In conclusion, PLE increases collagen production and maintains hyaluronic acid (HA) levels in human dermal fibroblasts exposed to UVB-irradiation, thereby inhibiting photoaging._x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_

30446244,Association of long-term PM(2.5) exposure with traditional and novel lipid measures related to cardiovascular disease risk,"Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, particularly for cardiovascular disease. The association between long-term exposure to PM2.5 and measures of lipoprotein subfractions remains unclear. Therefore, we examined associations between long-term PM2.5 exposure and traditional and novel lipoprotein measures in a cardiac catheterization cohort in North Carolina.This cross-sectional study included 6587 patients who had visited Duke University for a cardiac catheterization between 2001 and 2010 and resided in North Carolina. We used estimates of daily PM2.5 concentrations on a 1â€¯km-grid based on satellite measurements. PM2.5 predictions were matched to the address of each patient and averaged for the year prior to catheterization date. Serum lipids included HDL, LDL, and triglyceride-rich particle, and apolipoprotein B concentrations (HDL-P, LDL-P, TRL-P, and apoB, respectively). Linear and quantile regression models were used to estimate change in lipoprotein levels with each Î¼g/m3 increase in annual average PM2.5. Models were adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, history of smoking, area-level education, urban/rural status, body mass index, and diabetes.For a 1-Î¼g/m3 increment in PM2.5 exposure, we observed increases in total and small LDL-P, LDL-C, TRL-P, apoB, total cholesterol, and triglycerides. The percent change from the mean outcome level was 2.00% (95% CI: 1.38%, 2.64%) for total LDL-P and 2.25% (95% CI: 1.43%, 3.06%) for small LDL-P.Among this sample of cardiac catheterization patients residing in North Carolina, long-term PM2.5 exposure was associated with increases in several lipoprotein concentrations.

22308842,Retinol binding protein 4 is associated with adiposity-related co-morbidity risk factors in children,"In adults, elevated levels of retinol binding protein 4 (RBP4) have been associated with biochemical markers of adiposity-related co-morbidities including insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and abdominal obesity. This study examined the relationship between RBP4 and risk factors for co-morbidities of adiposity in a population of ethnically diverse children in early- to mid-adolescence in the public school system of New York City.We analyzed anthropometric (body mass index, % body fat, waist circumference), metabolic (lipids, glucose), and inflammatory (TNF-alpha, interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, adiponectin) markers for adiposity-related co-morbidities and serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in 106 school children (65 males, 41 females) 11-15 years of age (mean +/- SD = 13.0 +/- 0.1 years) who were enrolled in the Reduce Obesity and Diabetes (ROAD) project. Insulin sensitivity was assessed by quantitative insulin sensitivity check index. Insulin secretory capacity was measured as acute insulin response and glucose disposal index.Serum RBP4 was significantly correlated directly with ALT, triglycerides, and triglyceride z-score, and inversely correlated with adiponectin. Correlations with ALT and adiponectin remained significant when corrected for % body fat, age, and gender. There were significant ethnic differences in the relationship of RBP4 to ALT, glucose disposal index and adiponectin.In early- to mid-adolescents, circulating concentrations of RBP4 are correlated with multiple risk factors for adiposity-related co-morbidities. The observation that many associations persisted when corrected for % body fat, suggests that RBP4 can be viewed as an independent marker of adiposity-related co-morbidity risk in children.","Adiposity, Adolescent, Blood Glucose, Body Composition, Child, Comorbidity, Female, Humans, Inflammation, Insulin Resistance, Lipids, Male, Obesity, Prevalence, Retinol-Binding Proteins, Plasma, Risk Factors",no,no,unk,yes,U,22308842.0, Retinol binding protein 4 is associated with adiposity-related co-morbidity risk factors in children ,no,yes,yes,Unknown,,False

Statins are the most commonly prescribed medications to lower cholesterol, a major controllable risk factor for coronary heart disease.This study aims to find what factors in the first year of statin therapy are predictive of long-term all-cause mortality.Data for this retrospective cohort study were collected on patients identified as new statin users between December 1, 2006 and November 30, 2007 at five Veterans Affairs Healthcare Systems from Southern California and Nevada. Multiple independent variables were assessed utilizing a logistic regression model assessing for all cause mortality at 6 years follow-up. The independent variables included race, age, ethnicity, body mass index, socioeconomic status, and baseline comorbidities. Secondary analysis analyzed high-density lipoprotein levels, adherence, total cholesterol, and triglycerides.Increased age, increased medication count, hypertension, diabetes, tobacco use, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and congestive heart failure were all associated with an increased risk of mortality. Hispanic ethnicity, Asian race, and increased body mass index were associated with decreased risk of mortality. There were no significant associations between mortality and race, LDL outcomes at 1 year, or annual income level.There is clear evidence that statin use is associated with decreased events in cardiovascular disease and total mortality.

30137646,Early History of Home Parenteral Nutrition: From Hospital to Home,"Technologic advances in the past century have led to the ability to safely deliver parenteral nutrition (PN) to hospitalized patients. Key breakthroughs included the development of saline and glucose infusions, infusion pumps, macronutrients (lipids, dextrose, and amino acids), and central venous catheters. In the 1960s, centrally delivered PN was performed in short-term hospitalized patients by Lincoln James Lawson (North Staffordshire Royal Infirmatory, United Kingdom) and long-term patients by Stanley Dudrick (University of Pennsylvania, United States). These early studies showed that a system was needed that would allow patients with intestinal failure to be discharged from the hospital and receive home PN (HPN). In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Belding Scribner, Maurice Shils, Khursheed Jeejeebhoy, Marvin Ament, Dudrick, and their teams discharged patients from the hospital who then self-administered HPN. Shortly after these early cases of HPN, multidisciplinary centers were established first in North America, and later in Europe, to manage these complex cases. The current article describes the patients treated by these early HPN pioneers, in addition to subsequent case series reported by them and others.Â© 2018 American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition.","Animals, Central Venous Catheters, Europe, History, 20th Century, Hospitals, Humans, Infusion Pumps, Intestinal Diseases, Intestines, North America, Parenteral Nutrition, Home, Parenteral Nutrition, Total, Patient Discharge",no,yes,unk,yes,U,30137646.0, Early History of Home Parenteral Nutrition: From Hospital to Home ,no,no,no,"na, we",,False

Countries, institutions, authors, keyword occurrence analysis, and cooperation network analysis were performed using the CiteSpace and VOSviewer software.A total of 348 valid records were included in the final dataset, and the number of publications and the frequency of citations have grown rapidly over the last ten years. The USA (n = 175), China (n = 42), and Germany (n = 37) were the three largest contributors to the global publications on S1P and aging, while the Medical University of South Carolina (n = 15), University of California, San Francisco (n = 13), and University of Toronto (n = 13) were the leading institutions in this field. Analysis showed that early studies primarily focused on the mechanism of S1P intervention in AD. While S1P and its relevant metabolites have remained a long-term active area of research, recent studies have focused more on interventions aimed at improving retinal degeneration, cardiomyopathy, multiple sclerosis, and diabetes, among others.It is worth mentioning that this manuscript is the first to describe any bibliometric analysis of S1P and its application in age-related interventions. This study includes a discussion of the (1) historical overview of the topic; (2) main contributors: journals, countries, institutes, funding agencies, and authors; (3) collaboration between institutes and authors; (4) research hot spots and zones; and 5) research trends and frontiers.

23561430,Effect of lipid-modifying drug therapy on survival after abdominal aortic aneurysm repair,"Lipid-modifying drug therapy (LMDT) is recommended in all patients having coronary or noncoronary atherosclerotic disease. However, the effect of LMDT after abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair, especially in the absence of other atherosclerotic manifestations, is unclear. We examined the distribution of prevalence of LMDT among patients undergoing AAA repair and its effect on survival in the presence and absence of other atherosclerotic diseases.We identified patients treated at University of Alabama at Birmingham between 1985 and 2010 who had a prior AAA repair. Information was collected from health system medical charts, medical communication, and national death indices. We assessed the predictors of prevalence of LMDT by univariate analysis using t-test for continuous and Ï‡(2) test for categorical variables, and then performed multivariate logistic regression. The survival was determined using Kaplan-Meier plots, and adjusted hazard ratios were calculated using Cox proportion regression.A total of 2063 patients underwent AAA repair procedure. Of these, 9% were African-American, and 20% were female. Thirty-five percent received LMDT, and 32% died during the follow-up period of up to 240 months. Significant predictors for being on LMDT included white race (odds ratio [OR], 1.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-2.2), presence of other atherosclerotic disease or diabetes (OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.9-3.0), hypertension (OR, 4.0; 95% CI, 3.1-5.2), smoking (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2-2.1), and endovascular AAA repair (OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.5-2.3). LMDT was associated with improved survival (hazard ratio, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.5-0.8) after controlling for traditional risk factors, diabetes, and other atherosclerotic diseases.LMDT after AAA is associated with an increased survival compared with patients who were not using drug therapy for dyslipidemia. Aggressive management of dyslipidemia should be considered in all patients undergoing AAA repair irrespective of other atherosclerotic disease status and risk factor profile.Copyright Â© 2013 Society for Vascular Surgery.

22516882,Review of complementary and alternative medicine and selected nutraceuticals: background for a pilot study on nutrigenomic intervention in patients with advanced cancer,"As commonly defined, complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is a broad category that includes biologically based practices, mind-body medicine, manipulative and bodybased practices, and energy medicine as well as complete medical systems such as naturopathy, homeopathy, Ayurvedic medicine, and traditional Chinese medicine. Several CAM methodologies show promise for the treatment of chronic conditions such as depression and pain disorders or have demonstrated effects upon the immune response in experimental studies. There is growing interest in the use of integrative medicine the combination of CAM methodologies with a conventional medical approach-for the optimization of treatment of various cancers. The Ohio State University Center for Integrative Medicine has developed a specialized nutrigenomic protocol for integrative cancer care. The center uses a comprehensive nutritional and medical evaluation, including a panel of proinflammatory molecules and physiologic parameters, to guide a program of individualized dietary interventions. Dietary supplementation is a current focus of study, including: (1) Omega-3 fatty acids and B vitamins, which are thought to play important roles in immunomodulation; (2) Magnesium oxide, which has been shown to decrease inflammation and improve insulin resistance and lipid profiles; and (3) Cinnamon extract, which reportedly decreases serum glucose levels.

8916505,Potential of quantity of coronary artery calcification to identify new risk factors for asymptomatic atherosclerosis,"The goals of this study of adults asymptomatic for coronary artery disease (CAD) were to examine the relations between established CAD risk factors and quantity of coronary artery calcification (CAC) in three arterial locations using generalized linear mixed models and to estimate the variability in quantity of CAC explained by established CAD risk factors and the variability due to noise or artifact in the measure. The community-based sample included 740 asymptomatic adults (378 women) aged 20-59 years without hypertension or diabetes. Participants were recruited from Rochester, Minnesota, between 1990 and 1994. Quantity of CAC in three arterial locations was detected noninvasively by electron beam computed tomography. Sex, arterial location, age, body size, blood pressure, lipid metabolism, and smoking were significantly (p < 0.05) associated with quantity of CAC. Age was more strongly associated with quantity of CAC in the left than in the right coronary or circumflex arterial locations (p < 0.005). In each sex, risk factors together explained less than 40% of the variability in quantity of CAC. Noise or artifact in the measure accounted for only a small proportion of unexplained variability. Future studies of new risk factors for artery-specific quantity of CAC and its progression could provide additional etiologic insights into the atherosclerotic process.","Adult, Age Factors, Calcinosis, Coronary Angiography, Coronary Artery Disease, Coronary Vessels, Electrons, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Regression Analysis, Risk Factors, Sex Factors, Tomography, X-Ray Computed",no,no,unk,yes,U,8916505.0, Potential of quantity of coronary artery calcification to identify new risk factors for asymptomatic atherosclerosis ,no,no,yes,Unknown,,False

Methods: 413 patients with a mean age of 37.3ï‚±and 11.4 years were included in this study. Out of those, 120 were males, and 293 were females who were studied retrospectively. They had hyperinsulinemia and were referred to the clinic from 2017 to 2019. The factors studied were age, sex, body mass index (BMI), clinical signs, thyroid ultrasound, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lipids, fasting insulin, fasting glucose, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), Free thyroxine (FT4), and Zinc (Zn). Results: IR was detected in 252 individuals. The frequency of men with insulin resistance was significantly higher than in the control group - 72.50%, and 56.31%, respectively (F=9.55, p=0.0021). Mean thyroid volume in the patients with IR was significantly higher compared to the controls 20.52+6.39 cm3 and 15.25+6.55 cm3, respectively (p<0.001). Hyperinsulinemia had a significant positive correlation with Goiter r=0.445, p<0.0001. The associated factors for hyperinsulinemia are: Goiter (1) - OR=5.12 (95%CI:3.02-8.69); Cholesterol - OR= OR=3.31(95%CI:1.54-7.14); Triglycerides - OR=3.23(95%CI:1.02-10.28); Obesity (1)- OR=3.94(95%CI:2.23-6.98); Thyroid structural changes (1) - OR=2.01(95%CI:1.12-3.60); ALT/AST- OR=4.53(95%CI:2.33-8.80); Zn decreased Odds Ratio hyperinsulinemia - OR=0.95(95%CI:0.94-0.97); Conclusion: Hyperinsulinemia is the most common cause of diffuse goiter and the heterogeneous structure of the thyroid.

26353779,Fundus Autofluorescence Captured With a Nonmydriatic Retinal Camera in Vegetarians Versus Nonvegetarians,"A baseline level of lipofuscin in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is inevitable with age, but increased levels due to increased oxidative stress can result in deleterious vision loss at older ages. As earlier detection of differences in levels can lead to superior preventative management, we studied the relationship between lipofuscin accumulation and dietary lifestyle (vegetarian vs. nonvegetarian) in the younger, healthy South Asian population using retinal fundus autofluorescence (FAF) imaging.In this pilot study, we examined 37 healthy subjects (average age 23 years Â± 1) all undergoing similar stress levels as medical students at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School. Levels of lipofuscin concentrations were imaged using a FAF retinal camera (Canon CX-1). Two images (color and FAF) were captured of the left eye and included in the analysis. FAF quantitative scoring was measured in 2 regions of the captured image, the papillo-macular region (P) and the macula (M), by determining the grayscale score of a 35.5 mm(2) rectangle in the respective regions. Standardized scores (corrected to remove baseline fluorescence) were then obtained. Means, standard deviations, and t tests were performed for comparisons.Fundus autofluorescence scores of regions P and M were significantly different (P < .05) between groups. Region P was further standardized and results remained significant.Our preliminary results show that in this cohort, vegetarians had statistically significant lower levels of autofluorescence. These findings can have potential implications regarding long-term retinal health and risk for developing certain diseases over decades in subjects at risk for vision-threatening diseases.Â© 2015 Diabetes Technology Society.","Adult, Diet, Vegetarian, Female, Fundus Oculi, Humans, Lipofuscin, Male, Optical Imaging, Pilot Projects, Vegetarians, Young Adult",no,no,unk,yes,U,26353779.0, Fundus Autofluorescence Captured With a Nonmydriatic Retinal Camera in Vegetarians Versus Nonvegetarians ,no,no,yes,sa,,False

11739991,Joint effect of the APOE gene and midlife systolic blood pressure on late-life cognitive impairment: the Honolulu-Asia aging study,"The aim of this study was to explore the joint effect of the APOE epsilon4 allele and midlife systolic blood pressure (SBP) on the risk for poor cognitive function in late life.The study includes 3605 surviving members of the cohort of the Japanese-American men followed prospectively over 26 years (1965-1991) as a part of the Honolulu Heart Program. In 1965 men were aged 45 to 68 years and were living in the island of Oahu, Hawaii. For this study the sample was divided into 4 categories: normal SBP (<160 mm Hg)/No epsilon4, as the reference category; normal SBP/epsilon4; high SBP/no epsilon4; high SBP/epsilon4. The relative risk (RR) of late-life intermediate and poor cognitive function relative to good function was measured by the Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument (CASI) test.After adjusting for age, education, smoking, alcohol use, and body mass index, the RR for poor cognitive function (CASI <74) compared with good cognitive function (CASI >/=82) in never-treated subjects was 1.3 (95% CI 0.9 to 1.9) for the normal SBP/epsilon4 category, 2.6 (0.7 to 10.0) for the high SBP/no epsilon4, and 13.0 (1.9 to 83.8) for the high SBP/epsilon4. Adjustment for diabetes, prevalent stroke, coronary disease, and ankle-brachial index reduced the RR of poor cognition by 25.5% (RR 13.0 to 10.8) in those with both risk factors. In the treated group, the RR was 1.9 (0.7 to 4.5) for those with both risk factors.The results suggest that midlife high SBP has a stronger adverse effect on cognitive function in persons with higher genetic susceptibility, but this effect may be modified by antihypertensive treatment.","Aged, Aging, Alleles, Antihypertensive Agents, Apolipoprotein E4, Apolipoproteins E, Blood Pressure, Cognition Disorders, Cohort Studies, Comorbidity, Demography, Follow-Up Studies, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, Genetic Testing, Hawaii, Humans, Hypertension, Japan, Male, Risk, Risk Assessment, Risk Factors",no,no,unk,yes,U,11739991.0, Joint effect of the APOE gene and midlife systolic blood pressure on late-life cognitive impairment: the Honolulu-Asia aging study ,yes,no,yes,ea,,False

We studied a total of 741 white men, 453 black men, 786 white women, and 572 black women age 35-74 years. Age-adjusted HDL-C concentrations were higher in black than white men (48.6 vs 40.8 mg/dl) and in black than white women (56.1 vs 54.0 mg/dl). Life-style characteristics associated with HDL-C in women were exogenous hormone use, average number of cigarettes smoked per day, average ounces of alcohol consumed per week, body mass index, and use of beta-blockers. Life-style characteristics associated with HDL-C levels in men included age, average number of cigarettes smoked per day, average ounces of alcohol consumed per week, body mass index, and a self-reported history of diabetes. After adjustment for life-style characteristics, black men and women had HDL-C levels 7.0 and 5.3 mg/dl higher, respectively, than whites. Body mass index was a negative confounder in women; after adjusting for body mass and age, black women had HDL-C levels 4.6 mg/dl higher than white women. These data indicate that the measured life-style factors cannot fully explain the observed differences in HDL-C between blacks and whites.

A higher aHR of incident CVD was associated with comorbid hypertension (aHR = 2.18), diabetes (aHR = 1.38), obesity (aHR = 1.30), tobacco use (aHR = 1.47), and hepatitis C coinfection (aHR = 1.32), and older age (aHR = 1.26), but with a lower risk among females (aHR = 0.86). A higher risk of incident CVD events was also apparent in HIV-infected individuals with exposure to both protease inhibitors (adjusted risk ratio [aRR] = 1.99) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (aRR = 2.19) compared to those with no exposure. Sustained viral load suppression was associated with a lower risk of incident CVD events (aRR = 0.74)._x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_

17532322,Comparison of subclinical coronary atherosclerosis and risk factors in unselected populations in Germany and US-America,"On the basis of the Framingham risk algorithm, overestimation of clinical events has been reported in some European populations. Electron-beam computed tomography-derived quantification of coronary artery calcification (CAC) allows for non-invasive assessment of coronary atherosclerosis in the general population and may thus add important in vivo information on the path from risk factor exposure to formation of clinical events. The current study was undertaken to compare the relationship between risk factors and subclinical coronary atherosclerosis between non-Hispanic white cohorts in Germany and US-America, the hypothesis being that subclinical coronary atherosclerosis might be less prevalent in Europe at the same level of classical risk factor exposure.The Heinz Nixdorf Recall (HNR) study, conducted in the German Ruhr area and the Epidemiology of Coronary Calcification (ECAC) study, conducted in Olmsted County, Minnesota, both recruited large unselected cohorts, men and women aged 45-74 years, from the general population. All subjects with no history of coronary artery disease (CAD) or stroke were included (n=3120 in HNR, n=703 in ECAC). Coronary risk factors were assessed by personal and computer-assisted interviews and direct laboratory measurements. Cardiovascular medication use (antihypertensive, lipid-lowering, and anti-diabetic) was noted. CAC scores were determined using the Agatston method in an identical fashion in both studies.Adverse levels of risk factors were more prevalent, and the Framingham risk score was higher (10.6+/-7.6 versus 9.3+/-7.1, p<0.001) in HNR than ECAC, respectively. There was no difference in body mass index (BMI). CAC scores were greater in HNR than in ECAC (mean values, 155.7+/-423.0 versus 107.2+/-280.0; median values, 11.9 versus 2.4; p<0.001, respectively). When subjects were matched on CAD risk factors, presence and quantity of CAC were similar in the 2 cohorts. Risk factors significantly associated with CAC score in both studies included: age, male sex, current and former smoking, systolic blood pressure, and non-HDL-cholesterol. Inferences were similar after excluding subjects using lipid- or blood pressure-lowering medications. Using the same risk factor variables for modelling, the predicted CAC scores were comparable in both cohorts.In the higher-risk German cohort, presence and quantity of CAC were greater than in the lower-risk US-American cohort. Risk factor associations with CAC were very similar in both unselected populations. We could not demonstrate a relative increase in subclinical coronary atherosclerosis in the US-American cohort. It appears possible to compare CAC as a measure of subclinical coronary artery disease in different populations on different continents, and accordingly, scanning guidelines might be translated across these populations.","Aged, Cohort Studies, Coronary Artery Disease, Coronary Vessels, Female, Germany, Humans, Linear Models, Male, Middle Aged, Risk Factors, Tomography, X-Ray Computed, United States",no,no,unk,yes,U,17532322.0, Comparison of subclinical coronary atherosclerosis and risk factors in unselected populations in Germany and US-America ,no,no,yes,"na, we",,False
35592193,Computed Tomography Severity Scoring on High-Resolution Computed Tomography Thorax and Inflammatory Markers With COVID-19 Related Mortality in a Designated COVID Hospital,"Introduction Radiological Society of the Netherlands introduced the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) Reporting and Data System (CO-RADS) and the corresponding CT severity score (CTSS) to diagnose COVID-19 severity. However, data regarding the same is very limited. Objectives The objective of this study was to correlate the computed tomography severity scoring (CTSS) on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT)Â thorax and inflammatory markers with COVID-19 related mortality. Methods A retrospectiveÂ observational study was conducted in a tertiary center between June 2020 to May 2021 among 2343 adult patients at the department of radio-diagnosis with suspected and confirmed COVID-19 casesÂ who received an HRCT thorax. Data was collected retrospectively from the records regarding age, sex, and information regarding inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), D-dimer, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio. Information on HRCT thorax of patients was reviewed for radiological suspicion of COVID-19 related lung changes using CO-RADS scoring and severity of lung involvement using CT-severity scoring. Data was analyzed using SPSS version 22 (IBM Inc., Armonk, New York). Results The mean age was 51.69 Â± 16.02 years, and most of the study participants were male (1592, 67.95%). The majority (999, 42.64%)Â had diabetes as a comorbidity. The reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test was positive in 1571 (67.05%) participants. The majority (1571, 67.05%) had a CO-RADSÂ score of six, and only 150 (6.40%) had CO-RADS score of four. The CT severity score was normal in 147 (6.27%), mild in 724 (30.90%), moderate in 903 (38.54%), and severe in 569 (24.29%) participants. The CRP levels were moderate in 1200 (51.22%) and severe in 428 (18.27%) participants. The mean ferritin, D-dimer and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels were 321.83 Â± 266.42 ng/ml, 1.51 Â± 0.85mg/l, and 323.05 Â± 95.52pg/ml, respectively. The mean length of hospital stay was 10.25 Â± 6.52 days. Most of them (1926 out of 2343, 82.20%) survived, and nearly 417 out of 2343 (17.80%) died. Out of 2343, 569 participants had severe CT severity scores, out of which 205 (36.03%) died, and 364 (63.97%) participants survived. Conclusion A positive correlation was found between CT severity scoring on HRCT thorax and inflammatory markers with COVID-19 related mortality and can be used in early diagnosis and timely management of COVID-19 positive patients.Copyright Â© 2022, Ravindra Naik et al.",,no,no,we,yes,U,35592193.0, Computed Tomography Severity Scoring on High-Resolution Computed Tomography Thorax and Inflammatory Markers With COVID-19 Related Mortality in a Designated COVID Hospital ,no,no,yes,sa,,False
2127008,Gemfibrozil cost-benefit study. Targeting subgroups for effective hyperlipidaemia drug therapy,"This cost-benefit analysis attempts to translate the clinical findings of the Helsinki Heart Study (HHS) and published results regarding additional cardiovascular conditions into economic terms meaningful to US managed care providers. The study has the following 3 key objectives: to define the cost effectiveness of gemfibrozil in the prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD); to assess the net impact of gemfibrozil on total treatment costs for CHD; and to identify those patient groups for whom gemfibrozil therapy is most cost effective. In order to reach these findings a cost-effectiveness model was constructed based on original clinical data provided by the HHS, published findings for CHD risk and cost of treatment in the US, expert opinion and extension of HHS to other cardiovascular conditions, and documented costs and treatment protocols of US Medicaid and privately managed health care programmes. The model was applied to the California Medicaid (Medi-Cal) programme to estimate costs of hyperlipidaemia therapy using gemfibrozil. In parallel, savings to Medi-Cal from averted coronary events were estimated. From these data, the net expected savings to Medi-Cal were calculated. The probability of experiencing CHD varies with cholesterol level, age, sex and risk factors such as smoking, hypertension and diabetes. Therefore, it is possible to use risk-factor profiles to define groups of individuals with low, moderate or high risk of experiencing acute myocardial infarction (AMI) or sudden cardiac death. The probability of a cardiac event within 5 years ranges from 1.1% in a 45-year-old low risk male to over 36% in a 55-year-old high risk male. The average total cost of CHD care was found to be US$22,271 within 5 years. Using the probability of a CHD event to calculate the expected 5-year cost of CHD care produces a range from US$242 in the 45-year-old low risk male to US$8084 in the 55-year-old high risk male. Treatment with gemfibrozil reduces the probability of AMI and sudden cardiac death events by 34%, as demonstrated in the HHS. Therefore, the corresponding probability ranges are reduced to 0.7% in the 45-year-old low risk male and 27.3% in the 55-year-old high risk male after treatment with gemfibrozil. The expected cost of a coronary event is reduced by US$82 and US$1997, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)_x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_

12694341,Genetic aspects of diabetic nephropathy,"Background: Diabetic nephropathy from type 2 diabetes mellitus is the most common cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the United States and in Western Europe. Although patients with overt nephropathy generally experience greater cumulative glycemic exposure, the difference in glycemic control between patients developing nephropathy compared to those who did not, could not be demonstrated. This observation is consistent with the notion that perhaps other factors, in addition to glycemic control, have a bearing on the development of nephropathy.

29402120,Nicolae Constantin Paulescu: the first explicit description of the internal secretion of the pancreas,"The purpose of this article is to describe the research of Nicolae Constantin Paulescu and to emphasize his role in the discovery of insulin.We made a thorough review of the literature and research in the Romanian Academy Archive in order to find adequate references.In 1912 N.C. Paulescu analysed the clinical and biochemical alterations in diabetic patients and in dogs after performing a pancreatectomy, that apart hyperglycemia and glycosuria (carbohydrate metabolism), had noted also changes in lipid and protein metabolism. In 1916 he started the experiments with a pancreas extract obtained by his original method, that was injected intravenously to the diabetic dogs. The results of his first experiments showed: ""The pancreatic extract injected into a peripheral vein produce: 1) A diminution and even a temporary suppression of diabetic hyperglycemia, which may be replaced by hypoglycemia; 2) A diminution or even temporary suppression of glycosuria; 3) A diminution of blood urea; 4) A diminution of urinary urea. In other words, the intravenous injection of the pancreatic extract has as effect the disappearance of diabetic symptoms. The attenuation of the diabetic syndrome begins immediately after the injection. It reaches a maximum after 2 hours,- and it lasts for about 12 hours"". He concluded as such: ""This discovery,- which sheds a bright light over the pathogenesis of diabetes gives us also the key for the treatment of this syndrome"". In 1921, Paulescu had published extensively his data in two outstanding French journals 8 months before the first publication of Banting and Best from February 1922. It is clear that insulin has been discovered in Europe.Paulescu thought that a new hormone - Pancreine, that he discovered is the key element in the treatment of diabetes, but his outstanding research was unfairly neglected.","Animals, Canada, Diabetes Mellitus, Dogs, History, 20th Century, Humans, Insulin, Insulin Secretion, Pancreas, Physiology, Romania",no,yes,Unknown,yes,WE,29402120.0, Nicolae Constantin Paulescu: the first explicit description of the internal secretion of the pancreas ,no,yes,no,cee,,False

Markers of metabolic syndrome included fasting plasma glucose concentration, serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides (TG), waist circumference, the waist/hip ratio, body mass index (BMI) and blood pressure (BP). The frequency of the Thr54 allele was similar in the CHD patients (27.2%) and control subjects from two independent studies (27.8% and 28.7%). There were no significant differences in plasma glucose, serum lipids, BP, BMI, waist circumference or waist/hip ratio among the genotypes. Genotype frequency was not associated with the prevalence of diabetes or metabolic syndrome, but metabolic syndrome (as defined by National Cholesterol Education Program criteria) tended to be more frequent in subjects with the Thr/Thr genotype (p = 0.095).

12213907,An ATG repeat in the 3'-untranslated region of the human resistin gene is associated with a decreased risk of insulin resistance,"Resistin is overexpressed in human adipose tissue of obese individuals and is likely to modulate insulin sensitivity. Resistin is, therefore, a candidate gene for insulin resistance. We searched for polymorphisms in the resistin gene by single strand conformation polymorphism and direct sequencing. An ATG triplet repeat in the 3'-untranslated region was identified and considered for association with insulin resistance. Three alleles were identified (allele 1: 8 repeats, allele frequency, 0.3%; allele 2: 7 repeats; allele frequency, 94.5%; allele 3: 6 repeats; allele frequency, 5.2%). Two hundred and three unrelated white Caucasian nondiabetic subjects from Sicily and 456 from the Gargano area (center east coast of Italy) were analyzed. Among Sicilians, subjects carrying allele 3 had a lower fasting insulin and insulin resistance index (homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance; P < 0.001 for both) and glucose (P = 0.025) and insulin (P = 0.002) levels during the oral glucose tolerance test. In subjects from Gargano, those carrying allele 3 had lower fasting plasma glucose levels and serum triglycerides (P = 0.01 for both). When the 2 populations were analyzed together, subjects carrying allele 3 had lower fasting insulin levels (P < 0.005), homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (P < 0.005), and serum triglycerides (P = 0.01).

The objectives of the present study were to evaluate the effect of various peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor modulators viz. glimepiride, rosiglitazone and fenofibrate on chlorpromazine, clozapine and ziprasidone induced hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia in mice. Male Swiss albino mice were orally treated with chlorpromazine, clozapine and ziprasidone concurrently with the antidiabetic medications for 7 days. Plasma glucose, insulin and triglyceride levels were determined at the end of the study. Chlorpromazine and clozapine elevated the glucose and triglyceride levels in normal mice, with no effect on insulin but ziprasidone increased the basal triglyceride and insulin levels and did not have any effect on glucose. Glimepiride and rosiglitazone showed beneficial glucose and triglyceride lowering effects in chlorpromazine and clozapine animals and no effect on insulin levels. Fenofibrate significantly reduced the glucose levels only in animals treated with clozapine, and exhibited significant reduction of triglyceride levels in chlorpromazine, clozapine and ziprasidone treated animals. All three antidiabetic/hypolipidemic agents lowered triglyceride and insulin levels in ziprasidone treated animals. The results of the present studies suggest that hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia and hypertriglyceridemia induced by various antipsychotics may involve diverse mechanisms.","Animals, Antipsychotic Agents, Blood Glucose, Hypoglycemic Agents, Insulin, Male, Metabolic Diseases, Mice, Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors, Triglycerides",no,no,Unknown,yes,WE,16828808.0, Antipsychotic induced metabolic abnormalities: an interaction study with various PPAR modulators in mice ,no,no,yes,not applicable (animal study),,False
35947841,Gestational Nutrition as a Predisposing Factor to Obesity Onset in Offspring: Role for Involvement of Epigenetic Mechanism,"Maternal lifestyle has been implicated as a predisposing factor in the development of metabolic disorders in adulthood. This lifestyle includes the immediate environment, physical activity and nutrition. Maternal nutrition has direct influence on the developmental programming through biochemical alterations and can lead to modifications in the fetal genome through epigenetic mechanisms. Imbalance in basic micro or macro nutrients due to famine or food deficiency during delicate gestational periods can lead to onset of metabolic syndrome including obesity. A major example is the Dutch famine which led to a serious metabolic disorder in adulthood of affected infants. Notably due to gene variants, individualized responses to nutritional deficiencies are unconventional, therefore intensifying the need to study nutritional genomics during fetal programming. Epigenetic mechanisms can cause hereditary changes without changing the DNA sequence; the major mechanisms include small non-coding RNAs, histone modifications and most stable of all is DNA methylation. The significance association between obesity and DNA methylation is through regulation of genes implicated in lipid and glucose metabolism either directly or indirectly by hypomethylation or hypermethylation. Examples include CPT1A, APOA2, ADRB3 and POMC. Any maternal exposure to malnutrition or overnutrition that can affect genes regulating major metabolic pathways in the fetus, will eventually cause underlying changes that can predispose or cause the onset of metabolic disorder in adulthood. In this review, we examined the interaction between nutrition during gestation and epigenetic programming of metabolic syndrome._x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D__x000D_

However, in recent years a large number of epidemiological and clinical evidence has indicated that trans fats are a significant risk factor to suffer a cardiovascular event and appear to be involved in the process of inflammation, diabetes and cancer. The increase of 2% of the daily energy by TFA is associated with a 23% increase cardiovascular risk. Therefore, international organizations like WHO and PAHO recommend virtually eliminate them or make their consumption as low as possible, less than 1%. Considering this recommendation and the risk involved in its consumption, some countries in Europe and America have legislated to achieve a gradual reduction of these fats. Denmark is a country that has shown a reduced prevalence of cardiovascular disease by reducing sources of trans fats in the diet. Despite the evidence of their impact on health in many countries still do not take any action and significant amounts of TFA remain in their foods and therefore in the diet of its population.","Cardiovascular Diseases, Food Industry, Health, Health Status, Humans, Insulin Resistance, Legislation, Food, Neoplasms, Trans Fatty Acids",no,no,we,yes,WE,22566304.0, Trans fatty acids: consumption effect on human health and regulation challenges ,no,no,no,not specified,,False
16755316,The role of global risk assessment in hypertension therapy,"To maximize the benefits of preventive therapy, lipid and hypertension guidelines increasingly recommend that high-risk individuals be targeted for treatment. An individual's risk of developing cardiovascular disease depends on many risk factors, such as age, sex, blood pressure, blood lipid levels, body weight, physical fitness, smoking habits and familial predisposition. Multivariable statistical models have therefore been developed to better estimate the global risk of future coronary events and stroke. A Canadian model is not currently available because a prospective cohort of sufficient size has not been followed in Canada. Therefore, global risk assessment among Canadians can only be completed using models developed in the United States or Europe. In the present review, cardiovascular risk tools are identified that may be appropriate for Canadians, including those based on the Framingham model, the Cardiovascular Life Expectancy Model, the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) model and the Systematic COronary Risk Evaluation (SCORE) model. The accuracy of the Framingham model and the Cardiovascular Life Expectancy Model are also evaluated using data from a small, prospective Canadian cohort. Finally, a framework is proposed to assist health care professionals in choosing the global risk tool most appropriate for their patients.","Adult, Aged, Canada, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Heart Diseases, Humans, Hypertension, Male, Middle Aged, Models, Cardiovascular, Prospective Studies, ROC Curve, Risk Assessment, Risk Factors",no,no,we,yes,WE,16755316.0, The role of global risk assessment in hypertension therapy ,no,no,no,Unknown,,False
9627765,Aspartylglucosaminuria in a Canadian family,"Aspartylglucosaminuria (McKusick 208400) is a lysosomopathy associated with aspartylglucosaminidase (L-aspartamido-beta-N-acetylglucosamine amidohydrolase, EC 3.5.1.26) deficiency. It has been most frequently encountered in Finland, where the regional incidence may be as high as 1 in 3600 births. In North America it is very rare, having been reported in only 8 patients. We encountered 4 patients with aspartylglucosaminuria in a Canadian family of 12 siblings. The 4 siblings affected--2 brothers and 2 sisters--were apparently normal at birth; however, their developmental milestones, particularly speech, were slow, and they acquired only a simple vocabulary. Throughout life, there was a progressive coarsening of facial features; 3 had inguinal hernia and recurrent diarrhea; all became severely retarded and by the 4th decade showed evident deterioration of both cognitive and motor skills; 2 exhibited cyclical behavioural changes. Three of the siblings have died, at 33, 39 and 44 years of age. Two died of bronchopneumonia and 1 of asphyxiation following aspiration. In the urine of all 4 siblings, and in the 1 liver examined, we found 2-acetamido-1-N-(4-L-aspartyl)-2-deoxy-beta-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc-Asn) and alpha-D-mannose-(1,6)-beta-D-mannose-(1,4)-2-acetamido- 2-deoxy-beta-D-glucose-(1,4)-2-acetamido-1-N-(4-L-aspartyl)-2-deoxy-beta - D-glucosamine (Man2-GlcNAc2-Asn). Compared with the level of activity in controls, aspartylglucosaminidase activity was less than 2% in fibroblasts from 3 of the siblings, less than 0.5% in leukocytes from 1 sibling, and less than 1% in the liver of 1 sibling, whereas other acid hydrolase activities in these tissues were normal. Ultrastructural studies of skin showed that fibroblasts, endothelial cells and pericytes contained vacuoles with fine reticulo-floccular material. Glial and neuronal cells of the central nervous system showed similar inclusions as well as others composed of concentric or parallel membranous arrays intermingled with lipid droplets.","Acetylglucosamine, Adult, Aspartylglucosaminuria, Aspartylglucosylaminase, Canada, Child, Female, Humans, Lysosomal Storage Diseases, Male, Middle Aged, Pedigree",no,no,we,yes,WE,9627765.0, Aspartylglucosaminuria in a Canadian family ,no,no,yes,Unknown,,False
26911234,Serum long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and risk of orthostatic hypotension,"Long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) from fish have been shown to lower blood pressure. However, there is little information about the association with orthostatic hypotension, for which hypertension is a risk factor. We investigated the associations between serum long-chain omega-3 PUFAs and orthostatic hypotension in 1666 middle-aged or older men and women free of cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes or hypertension in 1998-2001 in the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study (KIHD) in eastern Finland. We also investigated the associations with mercury exposure, a major source of which is fish, and which has been associated with higher CVD risk in KIHD. Orthostatic hypotension was defined as decrease in systolic blood pressure of at least 20â€‰mmâ€‰Hg or diastolic blood pressure of at least 10â€‰mmâ€‰Hg within 1â€‰min of standing. Orthostatic hypotension was found in 146 participants (8.8%). The mean serum concentrations were 1.67% (s.d. 0.92) for eicosapentaenoic acid, 0.79% (s.d. 0.16) for docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) and 2.78 (s.d. 0.92) for docosahexaenoic acid of all serum fatty acids. The mean pubic hair mercury concentration was 1.5â€‰Î¼gâ€‰g(-1) (s.d. 1.6). We did not find statistically significant associations between the serum long-chain omega-3 PUFAs or pubic hair mercury and risk of orthostatic hypotension, except for DPA. Those in the highest vs. the lowest serum DPA tertile had multivariate-adjusted 41% lower odds for orthostatic hypotension (95% confidence interval 7-63%, P-trend=0.02). Serum long-chain omega-3 PUFAs or mercury exposure were not associated with the risk of orthostatic hypotension, except for the inverse association with DPA.","Adult, Aged, Blood Pressure, Fatty Acids, Omega-3, Fatty Acids, Unsaturated, Female, Finland, Humans, Hypotension, Orthostatic, Male, Mercury, Middle Aged, Risk Factors",no,no,we,yes,WE,26911234.0, Serum long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and risk of orthostatic hypotension ,no,no,yes,cee,,False
10789610,Hyperinsulinemia and the risk of cardiovascular death and acute coronary and cerebrovascular events in men: the Kuopio Ischaemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study,"The role of hyperinsulinemia as a cardiovascular risk factor is controversial. We studied whether hyperinsulinemia is independently associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.Fasting serum insulin level and other cardiovascular risk factors were determined in 1521 men in eastern Finland aged 42 to 60 years with neither cardiovascular disease nor diabetes at baseline. Forty-five cardiovascular deaths, 110 acute coronary events, 48 strokes, and 163 any cardiovascular events occurred during an average follow-up of 9.5 years. A total of 163 cardiovascular events (45 cardiovascular deaths, 110 acute coronary events, and 48 strokes) occurred during an average follow-up of 9.5 years.In Cox regression analysis adjusting for age and examination years, fasting serum insulin level as a continuous variable was directly associated with the risk of cardiovascular death (P = .006), acute coronary events (P = .04), and stroke (P = .02). Men with insulin levels of 52 to 66 pmol/L, 67 to 89 pmol/L, and 90 pmol/L or more (3 highest quartiles) had 1.4-fold (95% confidence interval, 0.5-3.7), 1.4-fold (95% confidence interval, 0.5-3.7), and 2.5-fold (95% confidence interval, 1.0-5.9; P = .05) cardiovascular mortality, respectively, compared with men with insulin levels of less than 52 pmol/L (lowest quartile) (P = .04 for linear trend). Adjustment for serum lipid levels, blood pressure, and obesity reduced the excess cardiovascular mortality in the highest insulin quartile by 7%, 33%, and 67%, respectively. There were no statistically significant differences in the incidence of acute coronary events and stroke between the insulin quartiles.Hyperinsulinemia had a modest association with increased cardiovascular mortality in middle-aged men. This relationship was largely explained by obesity, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. Hyperinsulinemia had even weaker associations with the risk of acute coronary event and stroke.","Acute Disease, Adult, Cardiovascular Diseases, Cerebrovascular Disorders, Confidence Intervals, Coronary Disease, Humans, Hyperinsulinism, Male, Middle Aged, Prospective Studies, Risk Factors",no,no,we,yes,WE,10789610.0, Hyperinsulinemia and the risk of cardiovascular death and acute coronary and cerebrovascular events in men: the Kuopio Ischaemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study ,no,no,yes,cee,,False
6590924,[Diagnostic significance of muscle biopsies in metabolic myopathies. II. Clinical biochemistry],"In the diagnosis of metabolic myopathies the use of biochemical methods, in addition to morphological examination of muscle biopsies, is often necessary in order to identify a specific metabolic defect. In order to narrow down the spectrum of biochemical methods, extensive clinical investigation and morphological examination, including histology, enzyme histochemistry and electromicroscopy if necessary have to be done beforehand. Patients are classified in the following groups: 1) progressive muscular weakness and/or muscle wasting with storage of a) glycogen, b) lipid or c) mitochondrial alterations; 2) recurrent rhabdomyolysis induced by fasting or exercise a) with glycogen storage or b) without any specific morphological alterations. The spectrum of metabolic defects comprises disorders of glycogen and glucose metabolism (deficiency of acid maltase, debranching and branching enzyme, phosphorylase, phosphofructokinase and other glycolytic enzymes), lipid metabolism (carnitine deficiency, carnitine palmitoyl transferase deficiency), mitochondria (respiratory chain disorders, pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency) and others such as adenylate deaminase deficiency. In some of these e.g. infantile acid maltase deficiency and mitochondriopathies, it is clinically more important when organs other than muscle are affected; however, muscle biopsy is a useful substrate for diagnosis of these metabolic disorders.","Adult, Biopsy, Carnitine, Diagnosis, Differential, Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel, Glycogen Storage Disease, Humans, Metabolism, Inborn Errors, Muscular Diseases",no,no,we,no,WE,6590924.0, Diagnostic significance of muscle biopsies in metabolic myopathies.

33997459,A study protocol of a randomized trial evaluating the effect of using defined menu plans within an intensive personal nutritional counseling program on cardiovascular risk factors: The MoKaRi (modulation of cardiovascular risk factors) trial,"Changes in dietary habits and lifestyle can reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease which is the leading cause of death worldwide. Objectives of the MoKaRi study The MoKaRi (modulation of cardiovascular risk factors) intervention study is designed to evaluate the effectiveness and potential of the developed MoKaRi concept. The MoKaRi concept comprises three components, each designed to improve dietary behavior. The first component entails using daily menu plans to implement a defined ""cardioprotective diet"". This diet consists of seasonal menu plans which are characterized by:(i) a personalized energy supply depending on his or her age, gender, level of physical activity.(ii) an adequate intake of carbohydrates, protein, fat, vitamins, minerals, and trace elements according to the guidelines of the German Society of Nutrition (DGE).(iii) a recommended intake of saturated fatty acids (SFA; < 7% of caloric intake (En%)), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA; > 10 En%), polyunsaturated fatty acids.(PUFA; approx. 10 En%), and long-chain n-3 PUFA (â‰¥500Â mg per day).(iv) measures to encourage consumption of vegetables and fruits, and.(v) eating more than 40Â g dietary fiber every day.Half of the participants will be scheduled to consume an additional 3Â g of long-chain n- 3 PUFA every day in the form of fish oil.The second component consists of regular one-on-one nutritional counseling, while a variety of further incentives make up the third component of the MoKaRi concept.The MoKaRi study will provide essential insights into the relationship between defined nutrient intake, markers of food intake and health status. Our specific aim is to investigate the influence of dietary and lifestyle choices have on cardiovascular health.The information and practical tools suitable for daily use, such as the personalized menu plans, could help to transfer knowledge on nutritional facts to the general population. In this way, the validated MoKaRi concept may contribute to the prevention and therapy of cardiovascular diseases.In line with our power calculation, we will enroll 60 participants and randomly assign them to one of two parallel arms. Each participant will receive personalized menu plans for each day of the study and will be provided with one-on-one nutritional counseling sessions every two weeks for a study period of 20 weeks (140 days). During this period, blood samples will be taken every 14 days (11 time points) and twice during a 20-weeks follow-up period. Incentives such as a supply of foods approved according t the standards of the study, a sports program, individual feedback on study parameters reflecting health status, and group activities round off the MoKaRi concept.Low-density cholesterol is the primary outcome measure of the MoKaRi study, and the secondary endpoints comprise markers of nutrient status (e.g. fatty acid distribution in plasma and erythrocyte lipids), a metabolomic profiling, diabetes risk markers, clotting markers, and further cardiovascular risk factors, such as blood lipids, homocysteine and high-sensitive c-reactive protein.The MoKaRi study was registered before launch at ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier NCT02637778; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02637778).Â© 2021 The Authors.

12656448,An update on 'progression promoters' in renal diseases,"This paper reviews progression in renal diseases.An English language literature search using Medline (1980 January-2001 July) was done to assess research and review articles on progression in renal diseases.Factors that increase the risk of progression in renal diseases are hypertension, dyslipidaemia, underlying nephropathy, high dietary protein intake and proteinuria. Others are smoking, hyperglycemia, low birth weight, obesity, metabolic syndrome X, genetic factors such as angiotensin converting enzyme 'DD' genotype and chromosome 1q21, and exposure to lead. Hypertension induces arteriolar nephrosclerosis. The mechanisms whereby lipids contribute to vascular and renal injury are incompletely understood. Glomerular hyperperfusion and increased proteinuria may explain the adverse effects of increased protein intake on renal disease progression. Proteinuria contains numerous toxic/inflammatory systems that promote progression. Cigarette smoking has vasoconstrictive, thrombotic and direct toxic effects on the vascular epithelium. Hyperglycemia is strongly implicated in the progression of complications in diabetics. Oligonephropathy in low birth weight has been suggested to increase the risk for systemic and glomerular hypertension in adult life. In obesity, the combination of hyperfiltration, glomerular hypertrophy and glomerular hypertension is a primary initiating event for glomerular injury manifesting as glomerulomegally and focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis and proteinuria. Angiotensin I, with enzyme insertion/deletion polymorphism, especially the ""DD"" genotype, predisposes to a rapid decline in renal function. Finally, long-term exposure to low levels of environmental lead affects renal function.The control of hypertension, dyslipidaemia, proteinuria, obesity, avoidance of low birth weight, smoking and heavy metals such as lead are intervention strategies for preventing progression of renal diseases.","Angiotensin II, Disease Progression, Humans, Hypertension, Kidney Diseases, Kidney Failure, Chronic, Risk Factors",yes,no,Unknown,yes,WE,12656448.0, An update on 'progression promoters' in renal diseases ,no,no,no,not specified,,False

We therefore sought to characterize the stool virome in children after onset of T1D and in matched control subjects from four geographically distant African and Asian countries.Samples of stool were collected from 73 children and adolescents shortly after T1D onset (Azerbaijan 19, Jordan 20, Nigeria 14, Sudan 20) and 105 matched control subjects of similar age and locale. Metagenomic sequencing of the DNA and RNA virome was performed, and virus positivity was defined as more than 0.001% of reads of the sample. Selected viruses were also quantified using real-time PCR. Conditional logistic regression was used to model associations with eukaryotic virus positivity.Signals of 387 different viral species were detected; at least one eukaryotic virus was detected in 71% case and 65% control samples. Neither of observed eukaryotic virus species or genera differed in frequency between children with T1D and controls. There was a suggestive association of the total count of different viral genera per sample between cases (1.45 genera) and controls (1.10 genera, OR 1.24, 95%CI 0.98-1.57), and an unplanned subanalysis suggested marginally more frequent endogenous retrovirus signal in cases (in 28.8% vs. in 8.6% controls, OR = 4.55, 95%CI 1.72-12).No clear and consistent association with T1D was observed in the fecal viromes from four distant non-European populations.

22151254,Genetic variants in potassium channels are associated with type 2 diabetes in a Mongolian population,"Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified more than 40 common sequence variants associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, the results are not always the same in populations with differing genetic backgrounds. In the present study, we evaluated a hypothesis that a North Asian population living in a geographic area with unusually harsh environmental conditions would develop unique genetic risks.A population-based association study was performed with 21 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in nine genes selected according to the results of GWAS conducted in other populations. The study participants included 393 full-heritage Mongolian individuals (177 diagnosed with T2D and 216 matched controls). Genotyping was performed by TaqMan methodology.The strongest association was detected with SNPs located within the potassium channel-coding genes KCNQ1 (highest odds ratio [OR] = 1.92; P = 3.4 × 10(-5) ) and ABCC8 (OR = 1.79; P = 5 × 10(-4) ). Genetic variants identified as strongly influencing the risk of T2D in other populations (e.g. KCNJ11 or TCF7L2) did not show significant association in Mongolia.  The strongest T2D risk-associated SNPs in Mongolians are located within two of three tested potassium channel-coding genes.

27420933,Correlation between PPARg2 gene Pro12Ala polymorphism and cerebral infarction in an Inner Mongolian Han Chinese population,"The variant of PPAR-g2 has been shown to promote the increase of carotid IMT in patients suffering from cerebral infarction and the Pro12Ala polymorphism in the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptorg2 (PPARg2) gene may be associated with cerebral infarction. However, due to the different genetic background, race, and regional variations of cerebral infarction patient, the results of investigations into this subject differ. The aim of this study was to investigate this polymorphism in relation to cerebral infarction among the Inner Mongolian Han Chinese population. A total of 574 Han Chinese individuals from Inner Mongolian were selected randomly, including 302 patients with cerebral infarction and 272 healthy controls. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism was used to determine genotypes of the PPARg2 Pro12Ala variant and results were confirmed by direct sequencing. Genotype frequencies were found to be 90.7 and 91.9% for P/P, 8.6 and 7.7% for P/A, and 0.7 and 0.4 for A/A in the cerebral infarction and control groups, respectively. No statistically significant differences in genotype distribution were observed between the two groups (P > 0.05). Moreover, PPARg2 Pro12Ala genotype was not significantly associated with altered fasting blood glucose, blood pressure, or serum lipid profiles. After adjustment for gender, body mass index, and smoking habit, logistic regression was used to analyze the relationship between the Pro12Ala polymorphism and cerebral infarction (odds ratio = 0.888, 95% confidence interval = 0.106-7.460, P > 0.05), revealing that this variant was not the main pathogenic factor involved. Therefore, the Pro12Ala mutation of PPARg2 may not be associated with cerebral infarction in the Inner Mongolian Han Chinese population.","Adult, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Case-Control Studies, Cerebral Infarction, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Mongolia, Mutation, Missense, PPAR gamma, Polymorphism, Genetic",yes,no,ca,yes,CA,,,,,,Unknown,,False
