      "Abstract: The prevalence of type 2 diabetes is disproportionately high among Asian Indians (AI), one of the fastest growing immigrant groups in the United States (US). Poorly controlled diabetes associated with inadequate self-management increases complications and thus medical costs. Acculturation may be an important determinant of diabetes self-management and hence control. This study examined the association between the degree of acculturation and glycemic control as measured by Hemoglobin A1c in AI adults with type 2 diabetes. A mixed method (quantitative and qualitative) study was conducted among 30 AI adults with type 2 diabetes. Acculturation assessment using the Suinn-Lew Asian Self-identity Instrument was followed by socio-demographic questions, self-reported anthropometric measures, and open ended diabetes self-care questions. A two-step multiple regression analysis and content analysis of verbatim interview transcriptions were conducted. Interactions of acculturation with body mass index (interaction b = 1.11; p = 0.01), annual household income (interaction b = 7.19; p = .01), and diabetes duration (interaction b = .30; p = .02) significantly predicted higher HbA1c levels (R(2) change = .368; F change = 4.21; p = .02). From the qualitative interviews, the following were regarded as US specific facilitators for glycemic control: excellent health care system and facilities, availability of healthy food choices and self-monitoring devices, medical insurance benefits, good quality medications, and improved health awareness. Cultural orientation might be important for patient tailored interventions targeting AI with type 2 diabetes. Therefore, interventions targeted at Asian Indians with diabetes should include culture specific adaptations to nutrition education and support.  \n",

Genome-wide linkage scans have localized common regions, possibly harboring susceptibility genes on chromosomes 1, 2, 12, and 20. Variability in linkage findings underscores the probable genetic heterogeneity of type 2 diabetes. Thus, we conducted a genome scan of diabetes status using maximum likelihood methods that model affection status by a liability threshold model. Hypertensive sibships and their offspring and/or parents in the Hypertension Genetic Epidemiology Network study were recruited from five field centers. The diabetes phenotype was derived using the World Health Organization criteria and adjusted for race/study center, age, age2, sex, and with and without percent body fat. In total, 567 diabetic participants were identified in 437 families. Variance component linkage analysis was performed among 1,545 Caucasians and 1,608 African Americans using race-specific marker allele frequencies. We detected a quantitative trait loci (QTLs) influencing diabetes variance (logarithm of odds = 3.4) on chromosome 22, which overlaps a positive type 2 diabetes finding among Canadian Oji-Cree Indians. We also observed suggestive evidence for linkage on chromosomes 1, 2, 5, 8, 14, 17, and 19. The identification and replication of type 2 diabetes QTLs will bring us closer to the detection of functional genes that influence diabetes susceptibility.\\n\\nMeSH: Chromosome Mapping*; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2 / epidemiology; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2 / genetics*; Diabetic Angiopathies / epidemiology; Female; Genome; Human; Humans; Hypertension / epidemiology; Hypertension / genetics*; Male; Middle Aged; Racial Groups, United States  \\n\\nOrganize your analysis of this abstract in a table, with the following columns: article name, precision medicine, diabetes, correct source population, primary study.\\n\"}],\n",

SGLT-2Is also have an anti-obesity effect, and reduction of body fat has been demonstrated by indirect methods. However, evaluation of the effect on the total visceral fat volume and intrahepatic lipid content has not been performed. \\n\\nResearch design and methods: We measured the abdominal subcutaneous fat volume (SFV) and visceral fat volume (VFV) by whole abdominal CT scanning, the intrahepatic lipid (IHL) content by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS), and the fat mass index (FI) and appendicular skeletal mass index (ASMI) by dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in 20 patients from our previous study. \\n\\nResults: Administration of ipragliflozin at 50 mg/day for 24 weeks significantly reduced SFV, VFV, and IHL. FI and ASMI were also significantly decreased. Changes of VFV and IHL content at 12 weeks were significantly correlated with the change of HbA1c, but no correlation was observed at 24 weeks \\n\\nConclusion: These findings demonstrate that ipragliflozin decreases visceral and hepatic fat, with improvement of glycemic control possibly being attributable to these changes at least up to 12 weeks. \\n\\nKeywords: Ipragliflozin; appendicular skeletal mass index; fat index; intrahepatic lipid content; intrahepatic visceral fat volume; subcutaneous fat volume; type 2 diabetes. \\n\\nMeSH: Blood Glucose / analysis; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2 / blood; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2 / diagnostic imaging; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2 / drug therapy*; Glucosides / administration & dosage; Glucosides / therapeutic use*; Humans; Intra-Abdominal Fat / diagnostic imaging; Intra-Abdominal Fat / drug effects*; Lipids / analysis*; Liver / diagnostic imaging; Liver / drug effects*; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Male; Obesity / prevention & control; Sodium-Glucose Transporter 2 Inhibitors*; Thiophenes / administration & dosage; Thiophenes / therapeutic use*; Tomography, X-Ray Computed \\n\\nOrganize your analysis of this abstract in a table, with the following columns: article name, precision medicine, diabetes, correct source population, primary study.\\n\"}],\n",

Gastrodin (GSTD) is a bioactive phenolic glucoside component of an ancient Chinese herb Tianma (Gastrodia elata Bl.), which is widely used for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases by ancient Chinese. Up to now, whether GSTD has a beneficial effect on DCM is unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effect of GSTD on high glucose-induced injury in H9c2 rat cardiomyocytes and HL-1 mouse cardiomyocytes, and its underlying mechanisms. High glucose (33 mM) treatment caused cardiomyocyte toxicity, oxidative stress and apoptosis in both H9c2 and HL-1 cells. Under both normal (5.5 mM glucose) and high glucose conditions, GSTD showed protective effect against high glucose-induced cytotoxicity and promoted the nuclear translocation of Nrf2 in a concentration and time-dependent manner in H9c2 and HL-1 cells. Knockdown of Nrf2 expression using siRNA specifically targeting Nrf2 attenuated the protective effect of GSTD. Furthermore, GSTD promoted the nuclear translocation of Nrf2 via activating glycogen synthase kinse-3beta (GSK-3beta) signaling pathway. 4-benzyl, 2-methyl, 1, 2, 4-thiadiazolidine, 3, 5 dione (TDZD-8), an inhibitor of GSK-3beta, inhibited the nuclear translocation of Nrf2 induced by GSTD, and attenuated the protective effect of GSTD as Nrf2 knockdown did. In summary, GSTD could protect against high glucose-induced cardiomyocyte toxicity via GSK-3beta-mediated nuclear translocation of Nrf2. \\n\\nKeywords: GSK-3beta; Gastrodin; Nrf2; cardiomyocyte toxicity; high glucose. \\n\\nMeSH: Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Nuclear Translocator / drug effects*; Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Nuclear Translocator / metabolism; Benzyl Alcohols / pharmacology; Benzyl Alcohols / therapeutic use*; Cells, Cultured / drug effects, Glucose / toxicity*; Glucosides / pharmacology; Glucosides / therapeutic use*; Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta / metabolism*; Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta / pharmacology; Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta / therapeutic use; Myocytes, Cardiac / drug effects*; NF-E2-Related Factor 2 / drug effects*; NF-E2-Related Factor 2 / metabolism; Protective Agents / pharmacology; Protective Agents / therapeutic use* \\n\\nOrganize your analysis of this abstract in a table, with the following columns: article name, precision medicine, diabetes, correct source population, primary study.\\n\"}],\n",

In total, 80 participants were randomized [38 in the placebo group (PG) and 42 in the supplemented group (SG)], but at the end of the protocol, 20 individuals in the PG and 15 in the SG were evaluated. The sample consumed one capsule of curcumin (500 mg/day) (Curcumin C3 Complex®) or a placebo for 90 days. Body weight, height, body mass index, WC, body fat, fat free mass, fasting glucose (FG), lipid profile [triglycerides (TGs), total cholesterol (TC), HDL-c and LDL-c], physical activity level and food intake (energy, carbohydrate, total fat and protein) data were evaluated before and after the intervention. \\n\\nResults: Curcumin supplementation reduced body mass (p < 0.040) but did not alter other anthropometric parameters or body composition (p  0.050). In relation to the biochemical profile, the SG saw reductions in FG (p < 0.001), TGs (p < 0.001) and TC (p = 0.001) compared with the PG. At the baseline and during the intervention, the practice of physical activity and food intake did not differ between the SG and PG (p  0.050). \\n\\nConclusion: Curcumin supplementation improved the blood glucose and lipid profile of Brazilian women with high WC, without altering body composition. New studies with larger sample sizes and longer durations are important for identifying more robust data regarding the proposal of this work. \\n\\nKeywords: Curcumin; blood glucose; cholesterol; triglycerides; women. \\n\\nMeSH: Blood Glucose* / metabolism; Body Mass Index; Brazil; Cholesterol, HDL; Curcumin*; Dietary Supplements; Female; Humans; Triglycerides; Waist Circumference \\n\\nOrganize your analysis of this abstract in a table, with the following columns: article name, precision medicine, diabetes, correct source population, primary study.\\n\"}],\n",

Changes in the gut microbiome have the potential to predict diabetes. Here, we aimed to identify alterations in the gut microbiome associated with diabetes in the high-risk population of Mexican Americans in South Texas. Stool samples were collected from 216 subjects from the population-based Cameron County Hispanic Cohort. Among them, 75 had type 2 diabetes. Taxonomic and functional profiling of the stool samples were assessed by 16S and shotgun metagenomic sequencing, and the influence of genetic factors was explored. The gut microbiome of subjects with diabetes was enriched with proinflammatory Proteobacteria members (Enterobacteriaceae, Escherichia-Shigella) and depleted of butyrate-producing Clostridiales members (Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Peptostreptococcaceae, and Clostridium sensu stricto 1). The accompanying metagenomic changes in subjects with diabetes suggested dysregulated amino acid metabolism, reduced galacturonate and glucuronate catabolism (correlating with Faecalibacterium prausnitzii abundance), and enriched heme biosynthesis (correlating with Enterobacteriaceae abundance). Polymorphism rs7129790 near MMP27 was strongly associated with high Proteobacteria abundance and was more frequent in this cohort and in individuals of Mexican ancestry than in Europeans. In conclusion, Mexican Americans in South Texas with diabetes display distinct gut microbiome and metagenomic signatures. These signatures may have utility in risk modeling and disease prevention in this high-risk population. IMPORTANCE The gut microbiome composition varies across ethnicities and geographical locations, yet studies on diabetes-associated microbiome changes specific to high-risk Mexican Americans are lacking. Here, we aimed to identify specific alterations associated with diabetes in this population, as well as host genetic factors that may explain increased disease susceptibility in this ethnic group. Using samples from a population-based cohort of Mexican Americans with a high prevalence of obesity and diabetes, we confirmed findings from studies on other ethnicities that suggested promotion of a chronic proinflammatory environment, loss of butyrate production, and compromised intestinal barrier integrity. High abundance of proinflammatory Proteobacteria was associated with a polymorphism that was more frequent in this cohort and in individuals of Mexican ancestry than in Europeans. Validation of microbiome-based risk models for diabetes should be evaluated in prospective cohort studies. \\n\\nKeywords: Mexican American population; diabetes; gut microbiome; health disparity; metagenome. \\n\\nMeSH: Butyrates; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2* / epidemiology; Enterobacteriaceae; Gastrointestinal Microbiome* / genetics; Humans; Mexican Americans / genetics; Prospective Studies; Texas / ethnology \\n\\nOrganize your analysis of this abstract in a table, with the following columns: article name, precision medicine, diabetes, correct source population, primary study.\\n\"}],\n",

A polymorphism (His215Arg) in NPC1 was associated with obesity in Europeans. Adaptations to diet and pathogens represented powerful selective forces; thus, we analyzed the evolutionary history of the gene and exploited this information for the identification of variants/residues of functional importance in human disease. \\n\\nMethods: We performed phylogenetic analysis, population genetic tests, and genotype-phenotype analysis in a population from Saudi Arabia. \\n\\n Results: Maximum-likelihood ratio tests indicated the action of positive selection on loop 2 and identified three residues as selection targets; these were confirmed by an independent random effects likelihood (REL) analysis. No selection signature was detected in present-day human populations, but analysis of nonsynonymous polymorphisms showed that a variant (Ile642Met, rs1788799) in the sterol sensing domain affects a highly conserved position. This variant and the previously described His215Arg polymorphism were tested for association with obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) in a cohort from Saudi Arabia. Whereas no association with obesity was detected, 642Met allele was found to predispose to T2D. A significant interaction was noted with sex (P = 0.041), and stratification on the basis of gender indicated that the association is driven by men (P = 0.0021, OR = 1.5). Notably, two NPC1 haplotypes were also associated with T2D in men (rs1805081-rs1788799, His-Met: P = 0.0012, OR = 1.54; His-Ile: P = 0.0004, OR = 0.63). \\n\\nConclusions: Our data indicate a sex-specific effect of NPC1 variants on T2D risk and describe putative binding sites for filoviruses entry. \\n\\nMeSH: Adult; Aged; Alleles; Amino Acid Sequence; Carrier Proteins / genetics*; Cohort Studies; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2 / epidemiology; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2 / genetics*; Evolution, Molecular; Female; Humans; Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins; Male; Membrane Glycoproteins / genetics*; Middle Aged; Models, Molecular; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutation, Missense; Niemann-Pick C1 Protein; Obesity / epidemiology; Obesity / genetics; Polymorphism, Genetic*; Receptors; Virus / genetics; Saudi Arabia; Selection, Genetic*; Sex Factors \\n\\nOrganize your analysis of this abstract in a table, with the following columns: article name, precision medicine, diabetes, correct source population, primary study.\\n\"}],\n",

Study Desing: Cross-sectional descriptive study.\\n\\nPlace and duration of study: Firat University Medical School, Elazig, Turkey between December 2018 and November 2020.\\n\\nMethodology: The cross-sectional descriptive study consisted of 37 patients with hypertensive nephropathy (group 3), 50 hypertensive patients without nephropathy (group 2), and 50 healthy controls (group 1). Hypertensive nephropathy was defined as serum creatinine 1.8 mg / dl or GFR <40 ml / minute. Biochemical parameters (Glucose, AST, ALT, urea, creatinine, lipid levels, hemogram, calcium, phosphorus, parathormone) and the levels of serum Elabela were evaluated and compared.\\n\\nResults: There was no significant difference in age (0.270) and gender (0.951) between groups. The median Elabela levels of the three groups were 40.3 ng/mL (22.5-54.6), 5.1 ng/mL (3.7-8.3), 9.2 ng/mL (6.1-23.1), respectively with a significant difference (p<0.001).\\n\\nConclusion: The plasma levels of Elabela were lower in the case of hypertension, independent of nephropathy. However, this decrease is not specific for nephropathy and may be due to other accompanying chronic diseases.

To identify genes that affect these traits and disorders, we looked for association between markers in candidate genes (apolipoprotein AII (apo AII), apolipoprotein AI-CIII-AIV gene cluster (apo AI-CIII-AIV), apolipoprotein E (apo E), cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7a), hepatic lipase (HL), and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP)) and known risk factors (triglycerides (Tg), total cholesterol (TC), apolipoprotein AI (apo AI), apolipoprotein AII (apo AII), apolipoprotein B (apo B), body mass index (BMI), blood pressure (BP), leptin, and fasting blood sugar (FBS) levels.) A total of 1,102 individuals from the Pacific island of Kosrae were genotyped for the following markers: Apo AII/MspI, Apo CIII/SstI, Apo AI/XmnI, Apo E/HhaI, CETP/TaqIB, CYP7a/BsaI, HL/DraI, and MTP/HhpI. After testing for population stratification, family-based association analysis was carried out. Novel associations found were: 1) the apo AII/MspI with apo AI and BP levels, 2) the CYP7a/BsaI with apo AI and BMI levels. We also confirmed the following associations: 1) the apo AII/MspI with Tg level; 2) the apo CIII/SstI with Tg, TC, and apo B levels; 3) the Apo E/HhaI E2, E3, and E4 alleles with TC, apo AI, and apo B levels; and 4) the CETP/TaqIB with apo AI level. We further confirmed the connection between the apo AII gene and Tg level by a nonparametric linkage analysis. We therefore conclude that many of these candidate genes may play a significant role in susceptibility to heart disease. \\n\\nMeSH: Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alleles; Apolipoprotein A-I / blood; Apolipoprotein A-I / genetics; Apolipoprotein A-II / blood; Apolipoprotein A-II / genetics; Apolipoproteins E / blood; Apolipoproteins E / genetics; Cardiovascular Diseases / blood; Cardiovascular Diseases / genetics*; Carrier Proteins / blood; Carrier Proteins / genetics; Cholesterol 7-alpha-Hydroxylase / blood; Cholesterol 7-alpha-Hydroxylase / genetics; Cholesterol Ester Transfer Proteins; DNA / genetics; Family Health; Female; Gene Frequency; Genetic Predisposition to Disease / genetics*; Genotype; Glycoproteins*; Humans; Lipase / blood; Lipase / genetics; Male; Micronesia; Microsatellite Repeats; Middle Aged; Polymorphism, Genetic; Risk Factors \\n\\nOrganize your analysis of this abstract in a table, with the following columns: article name, precision medicine, diabetes, correct source population, primary study.\\n\"}],\n",

The first population was located in a remote rural area and the other in an urban environment. There was no significant difference between the two populations in age, height and diastolic blood pressure. Highly significant differences were observed in mean weight, body mass index, prevalence of impaired glucose tolerance, prevalence of diabetes, mean glycosolated haemoglobin, mean systolic blood pressure, fasting cholesterol, immunological albumin, immunological transferrin, and A1 and B apolipoproteins. The higher value was associated with urban living. Thus urban living is associated with obesity, impaired glucose tolerance, diabetes, higher systolic blood pressure, higher levels of fasting lipids and increased risk factors for cardiovascular disease. \\n\\nMeSH: Apolipoprotein A-I; Apolipoproteins A / blood; Apolipoproteins B / analysis; Body Mass Index; Cholesterol / blood; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2 / epidemiology*; Female; Glucose Tolerance Test; Glycated Hemoglobin / analysis; Humans; Hypertension / epidemiology*; Lipoproteins, HDL / analysis; Male; Melanesia / epidemiology; Middle Aged; Obesity / epidemiology*; Rural Health*; Serum Albumin / analysis; Transferrin / analysis; Urban Health* \\n\\nOrganize your analysis of this abstract in a table, with the following columns: article name, precision medicine, diabetes, correct source population, primary study.\\n\"}],\n",

It has been hypothesized that SIRT7 affects growth traits in animals; therefore, in this study, the potential insertion/deletion (indel) of genetic variations within the ovine SIRT7 gene and their correlation with sheep growth traits were explored. A total of 709 individuals from five Chinese and Mongolian sheep breeds were analyzed. Two novel indel loci of the sheep SIRT7 gene were detected and were named 5' promoter region-insertion-7 bp (5' promoter region-7 bp) and 3' UTR-insertion-17 bp (3' UTR-17 bp), respectively. In all of the sheep breeds, frequencies of the 5' promoter region-7 bp mutation were low, whereas mutations of 3' UTR-17 bp were high in Tong sheep and Lanzhou fat-tail sheep (LFTS). Furthermore, both indel polymorphisms had significant associations with different growth characteristics (P<0.05). Among these associations, the 3' UTR-17 bp was highly correlated with rump width in small-tail Han sheep (STHS, rams; P<0.01), and individuals with the ID genotype had better chest depth values than those with the II genotype. In this paper, two novel indels within the sheep SIRT7 gene were identified, and genetic diversity and its effects on body size traits were explored. These findings will potentially provide useful DNA markers for the improvement of economic traits in sheep genetic breeding. \\n\\nMeSH: \\n\\nOrganize your analysis of this abstract in a table, with the following columns: article name, precision medicine, diabetes, correct source population, primary study.\\n\"}],\n",

Glycans on proteins reflect genetic, metabolic and environmental factors. However, associations of IgG glycans with type 2 diabetes have not been described. We compared IgG N-glycan patterns in type 2 diabetes with healthy subjects. \\n\\nMethods: In the DiaGene study, a population-based case-control study, (1886 cases and 854 controls) 58 IgG glycan traits were analyzed. Findings were replicated in the population-based CROATIA-Korcula-CROATIA-Vis-ORCADES studies (162 cases and 3162 controls), and meta-analyzed. AUCs of ROC-curves were calculated using 10-fold cross-validation for clinical characteristics, IgG glycans and their combination. \\n\\nResults: After correction for extensive clinical covariates, 5 IgG glycans and 13 derived traits significantly associated with type 2 diabetes in meta-analysis (after Bonferroni correction). Adding IgG glycans to age and sex increased the AUC from 0.542 to 0.734. Adding them to the extensive model did not substantially improve the AUC. The AUC for IgG glycans alone was 0.729. \\n\\nConclusions: Several IgG glycans and traits firmly associate with type 2 diabetes, reflecting a pro-inflammatory and biologically-aged state. IgG glycans showed limited improvement of AUCs. However, IgG glycans showed good prediction alone, indicating they may capture information of combined covariates. The associations found may yield insights in type 2 diabetes pathophysiology. \\n\\nGeneral significance: This work shows that IgG glycomic changes have biomarker potential and may yield important insights into pathophysiology of complex public health diseases, illustrated here for the first time in type 2 diabetes. \\n\\nKeywords: Ageing; Glycosylation; IgG; Inflammation; Prediction; Type 2 diabetes.\\n\\nMeSH: Aged; Area Under Curve; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2 / etiology*; Female; Galactose / metabolism; Glycosylation; Humans; Immunoglobulin G / metabolism*; Male; Middle Aged; N-Acetylneuraminic Acid / metabolism \\n\\nOrganize your analysis of this abstract in a table, with the following columns: article name, precision medicine, diabetes, correct source population, primary study.\\n\"}],\n",

The human genome contains 22 UGT genes which could be classified into four families: UGT1, UGT2, UGT3, and UGT8. The UGT8 family contains only one member which utilizes UDP galactose to galactosidate ceramide. Although higher UGT8 mRNA was observed in some types of cancer, its pathological significances remain elusive. Here, by integrating the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), and the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) databases, we showed that UGT8 was selectively highly expressed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and associated with worse prognosis. The transcription factor SOX9 promoted UGT8 expression in NSCLC by recognizing two putative response elements localized on the promoter region of UGT8. Silencing UGT8 impaired glycolysis and reduced the malignancy of NSCLC cells both in vitro and in vivo. On the contrary, inhibition of glycolysis by 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG) significantly impaired the pro-proliferation function of UGT8 in NSCLC cells. In conclusion, our results suggest that UGT8 maintains the malignancy of NSCLC mainly via enhanced glycolysis and provides a promising therapeutic target for NSCLC. \\n\\nKeywords: Glycolysis; NSCLC; SOX9; UGT8. \\n\\nMeSH: A549 Cells; Animals; Atlases as Topic; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung / genetics; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung / metabolism; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung / mortality; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung / pathology; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Movement; Cell Proliferation; Datasets as Topic; Ganglioside Galactosyltransferase / genetics; Ganglioside Galactosyltransferase / metabolism; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Glycolysis / genetics*; Humans; Lung Neoplasms / genetics*; Lung Neoplasms / metabolism; Lung Neoplasms / mortality; Lung Neoplasms / pathology; Male; Mice; Mice, Nude; Neoplasm Invasiveness; RNA, Messenger / genetics; RNA, Messenger / metabolism; RNA, Small Interfering / genetics; RNA, Small Interfering / metabolism; SOX9 Transcription Factor / antagonists & inhibitors; SOX9 Transcription Factor / genetics*; SOX9 Transcription Factor / metabolism; Signal Transduction;  Survival Analysis; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays** \\n\\nOrganize your analysis of this abstract in a table, with the following columns: article name, precision medicine, diabetes, correct source population, primary study.\\n\"}],\n",

(M. oleifera) leaves have long been consumed as both nutritive vegetable and popular folk medicine for hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia in Kenya communities. In the current study, in vitro inhibition by M. oleifera leaf extract (MOLE, 90% (v/v) ethanol) of alpha-glucosidase and pancreatic lipase was demonstrated, followed by determination of the effects of MOLE on both glucose consumption and lipid levels (TC, TG, HDL-C and LDL-C) in 3T3-L1 cells. Potential ligands in MOLE were fast screened using affinity ultrafiltration LC-MS, and 14 and 10 components displayed certain binding affinity to alpha-glucosidase and pancreatic lipase, respectively. Docking studies revealed the binding energies and hydrogen bonds between potential ligands and enzymes. This study suggests that M. oleifera leaves may be a promising natural source for the prevention and treatment of hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia as well as a functional food or other product for health care in the near future.\\n\\nKeywords: Hyperglycemia; Hyperlipidemia; Moringa oleifera; Pancreatic lipase; UF-LC/MS; alpha-glucosidase.\\n\\nMeSH: 3T3-L1 Cells; Animals; Glycoside Hydrolase Inhibitors / chemistry; Glycoside Hydrolase Inhibitors / pharmacology; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents / chemistry; Hypoglycemic Agents / pharmacology; Hypolipidemic Agents / chemistry; Hypolipidemic Agents / pharmacology; Lipase / antagonists & inhibitors; Lipid Metabolism / drug effects; Mice; Moringa oleifera / chemistry*; Plant Extracts / chemistry*; Plant Extracts / pharmacology*; Plant Leaves / chemistry* \\n\\nOrganize your analysis of this abstract in a table, with the following columns: article name, precision medicine, diabetes, correct source population, primary study.\\n\"}],\n",

Susceptibility loci other than HLA and the insulin gene remain to be identified to account for the degree of familial clustering observed in this disorder. Early genome-wide scans provided suggestive evidence of linkage on chromosome 8q, prompting detailed analysis of this region. A total of 20 microsatellite markers spanning an 88-cM region of 8q11-24 were genotyped in 24 type 1 diabetes pedigrees from Wisconsin that contained 39 affected sib-pairs. Multipoint linkage analyses provided close to suggestive evidence of linkage, with a multipoint logarithm of odds score (MLS) of 2.4 and Genehunter nonparametric logarithm of odds score (NPL) of 2.7 (P = 0.003). There is also evidence of linkage disequilibrium at peak marker D8S1823 for the 217bp allele (P = 0.037) using the pedigree disequilibrium test. Although our sample size was small, the multiple tests were consistent and our preliminary results suggested that 8q24 may harbor a novel population-specific type 1 diabetes susceptibility gene. Continued investigation of this region for a novel type 1 diabetes susceptibility gene appears justified.\\n\\nMeSH: Chromosome Mapping; Chromosomes, Human; Pair 8 / genetics; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1 / genetics*; Genetic Linkage; Genetic Markers; Genetic Predisposition to Disease / genetics*; Genotype; Humans; Microsatellite Repeats\\n\\nOrganize your analysis of this abstract in a table, with the following columns: article name, precision medicine, diabetes, correct source population, primary study.\\n\"}],\n",

To validate the trans-ethnic contribution of the single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) involved in these GWASs, we performed a family-based association analysis of 32 selected GWAS SNPs in a cohort of 1496 African-American (AA) subjects from the Genetics of NIDDM (GENNID) study. Functional roles of these SNPs were evaluated by screening cis-eQTLs in transformed lymphoblast cell lines available for a sub-group of Genetics of NIDDM (GENNID) families from Arkansas. Only three of the 32 GWAS-derived SNPs showed nominally significant association with T2D in our AA cohort. Among the replicated SNPs rs864745 in JAZF1 and rs10490072 in BCL11A gene (P=0.006 and 0.03, respectively, after adjustment for body mass index) were within the 1-lod drop support interval of T2D linkage peaks reported in these families. Genotyping of 19 tag SNPs in these two loci revealed no further common SNPs or haplotypes that may be a stronger predictor of T2D susceptibility than the index SNPs. Six T2D GWAS SNPs (rs6698181, rs9472138, rs730497, rs10811661, rs11037909 and rs1153188) were associated with nearby transcript expression in transformed lymphoblast cell lines of GENNID AA subjects. Thus, our study indicates a nominal role for JAZF1 and BCL11A variants in T2D susceptibility in AAs and suggested little overlap in known susceptibility to T2D between European- and African-derived populations when considering GWAS SNPs alone. \\n\\nMeSH: Black or African American / genetics*; Carrier Proteins / genetics*; Carrier Proteins / metabolism; Co-Repressor Proteins; DNA-Binding Proteins; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2 / genetics*; Family; Gene Expression Regulation; Genetic Predisposition to Disease*; Genome-Wide Association Study*; Humans; Neoplasm Proteins / genetics*; Neoplasm Proteins / metabolism; Nuclear Proteins / genetics*; Nuclear Proteins / metabolism; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide / genetics*; RNA, Messenger / genetics; RNA, Messenger / metabolism; Repressor Proteins \\n\\nOrganize your analysis of this abstract in a table, with the following columns: article name, precision medicine, diabetes, correct source population, primary study.\\n\"}],\n",

The patients were classified according to the level of SCI and their age.\\n\\nMethods: Serum lipid profiles and glycemic (glucose) levels were determined. Data was collected between 1996 and 2001, all biochemical analysis being performed by the same laboratory.\\n\\nResults: Serum cholesterol levels show a statistically significant correlation with patient's age(P<0.001) and with time elapsed after injury (P<0.05). Differences can be observed between the values obtained from the different injury level groups (F=22.14; P<0.001). LDL-c shows a statistically significant difference between the four different age groups (F=3.51, P<0.05). There is an increase in plasma triglycerides related to the increase in age of the patients without observable differences between the injury level groups. The concentration of serum glucose increases with age (P<0.001) and also with the time elapsed after injury (P<0.05).\\n\\nConclusion: There is a direct relationship between various biochemical parameters (total cholesterol, LDL-c and glucose) and the age of the patients, but not with the severity or time of evolution of the spinal cord injury.\\n\\nMeSH: Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Blood Glucose / metabolism*; Cervical Vertebrae / injuries; Cholesterol / blood*; Cholesterol, HDL / blood; Cholesterol, LDL / blood; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Lumbar Vertebrae / injuries; Male; Middle Aged; Patients / statistics & numerical data; Spinal Cord Injuries / blood*; Thoracic Vertebrae / injuries; Time; Time Factors \\n\\nOrganize your analysis of this abstract in a table, with the following columns: article name, precision medicine, diabetes, correct source population, primary study.\\n\"}],\n",

Identification of such variants contributes to our understanding of the genetic aetiology of diseases and improves global equity in genomic personalised medicine. We aimed to identify and characterise novel variants in genes associated with Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY) in the Greenlandic population.\\n\\nMethods: Using combined data from Greenlandic population cohorts of 4497 individuals, including 448 whole genome sequenced individuals, we screened 14 known MODY genes for previously identified and novel variants. We functionally characterised an identified novel variant and assessed its association with diabetes prevalence and cardiometabolic traits and population impact.\\n\\nFindings: We identified a novel variant in the known MODY gene HNF1A with an allele frequency of 1.9% in the Greenlandic Inuit and absent elsewhere. Functional assays indicate that it prevents normal splicing of the gene. The variant caused lower 30-min insulin (beta = -232 pmol/L, betaSD = -0.695, P = 4.43 × 10-4) and higher 30-min glucose (beta = 1.20 mmol/L, betaSD = 0.441, P = 0.0271) during an oral glucose tolerance test. Furthermore, the variant was associated with type 2 diabetes (OR 4.35, P = 7.24 × 10-6) and HbA1c (beta = 0.113 HbA1c%, betaSD = 0.205, P = 7.84 × 10-3). The variant explained 2.5% of diabetes variance in Greenland.\\n\\nInterpretation: The reported variant has the largest population impact of any previously reported variant within a MODY gene. Together with the recessive TBC1D4 variant, we show that close to 1 in 5 cases of diabetes (18%) in Greenland are associated with high-impact genetic variants compared to 1-3% in large populations.\\n\\nFunding: Novo Nordisk Foundation, Independent Research Fund Denmark, and Karen Elise Jensen's Foundation.\\n\\nMeSH: \\n\\nOrganize your analysis of this abstract in a table, with the following columns: article name, precision medicine, diabetes, correct source population, primary study.\\n\"}],\n",
