Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Present study explored pattern and predictors of dyslipidemia in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. The cross-sectional study is conducted among 366 consecutive eligible T2DM patients aged >30 years, BIRDEM diabetic hospital, during July-to-December 2010. Physical examination, diabetic profile, lipid profile and serum createnine was performed. Adjusted odds ratio and confidence limit were generated through binary logistic regression. Most frequent form (59.3%) of dyslipidemia is low HDL. Duration of T2DM is significantly correlated with TC (P<0.05), HDL (P<0.05) and LDL (P<0.05) in both male and female. Glycemic control in terms of HbA1c >7% appeared as predictor of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). Duration T2DM is associated with increased risk of having higher TC (P<0.05), LDL (P<0.05) and lower HDL (P<0.01) and does not seem to affect triglyceride (P>0.05). T2DM with comorbid hypertension seems to predict hyper tri-glyceridemia and lower HDL. Both TC-HDL ratio and LDL-HDL ratio appeared as good predictor of all four parameters of dyslipidemia (P<0.01). The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are low HDL, high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol level. Low HDL level is the most frequent type of abnormality. Poor glycemic control, prolonged duration, coexisting hypertension predicts dyslipidemia in T2DM.Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
